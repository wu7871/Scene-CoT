## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern kitchen that emphasizes efficiency and aesthetics, featuring a stainless steel refrigerator, an oven, and a ceramic sink counter. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design should incorporate a central island for meal preparation, complemented by modern lighting fixtures to ensure adequate illumination. The user prefers a minimalist style, avoiding clutter while maximizing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures: the Refrigerator Area, Oven Area, Sink Counter Area, Meal Preparation Island, and Lighting Area. Each substructure serves a specific purpose, such as food storage, cooking, washing, meal preparation, and ambiance creation. The central location of the Meal Preparation Island ensures it remains accessible and functional without obstructing the flow between other kitchen elements.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Refrigerator Area, a modern stainless steel refrigerator is recommended, serving as both a functional and aesthetic centerpiece. The Oven Area features a matching stainless steel oven, enhancing the kitchen's cohesive design. The Sink Counter Area includes a ceramic sink counter, complemented by a modern faucet for functionality. The Meal Preparation Island is centrally located, featuring a modern countertop and bar stools for seating. A ceiling light fixture is recommended for the Lighting Area to ensure even illumination throughout the kitchen.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator, a key component of the kitchen, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space efficiency and allows for easy access and maintenance. The refrigerator's dimensions are 1.1 meters in length, 0.9 meters in width, and 2.0 meters in height. Its placement against the wall ensures stability and leaves ample space for other kitchen elements, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The oven is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. With dimensions of 1.0 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 2.0 meters in height, it complements the refrigerator's placement without causing spatial conflicts. This arrangement facilitates efficient workflow in the kitchen, ensuring both appliances are accessible and maintain aesthetic consistency with their stainless steel finish.

The sink counter, measuring 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.9 meters in height, is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures no overlap with existing objects and maintains a cohesive kitchen layout. The sink counter's modern style and ceramic material add visual interest and functionality, supporting the kitchen's overall design.

The meal preparation island, with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.95 meters, is centrally located in the room. This central placement ensures accessibility from all sides, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal. The island's modern style and dark wood color contrast nicely with the stainless steel of the refrigerator and oven, adding visual interest.

Bar stool 1, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed directly in front of the meal preparation island, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures it does not obstruct the sink counter or oven, maintaining a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout. Bar stool 2, identical in size, is placed behind the meal preparation island, facing the north wall, creating a balanced seating arrangement around the island.

The ceiling light, with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters, is centrally located on the ceiling, directly above the meal preparation island. This placement ensures even lighting distribution across the kitchen, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose with the placement of the faucet and dishwasher. The width of the sink counter was insufficient to accommodate the faucet to its left, leading to a decision to remove the faucet due to its lower functional priority compared to the sink counter itself. Additionally, the oven's width could not accommodate the dishwasher to its right, resulting in the removal of the dishwasher to maintain the kitchen's modern aesthetic and functionality.
