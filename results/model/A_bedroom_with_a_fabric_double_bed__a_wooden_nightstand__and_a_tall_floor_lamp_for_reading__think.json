## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a bedroom that emphasizes comfort and functionality, featuring a fabric double bed, a wooden nightstand, and a tall floor lamp for reading. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional elements such as a rug, wall art, or a chair. The user prioritizes a cozy atmosphere with adequate lighting and storage, suggesting the inclusion of a rug to define the sleeping area and wall art to add personality. The design should maintain a harmonious color palette and cohesive style, with a focus on essential items that enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area is defined by the fabric double bed, which serves as the focal point of the room. Adjacent to this is the Bedside Area, where the wooden nightstand provides storage and support for the floor lamp. The Lighting Area is defined by the placement of the floor lamp, ensuring adequate illumination for reading. Additionally, a central Rug Area is proposed to define the sleeping zone, while Wall Art Areas on both the north and south walls can add visual interest and personality to the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a classic-style fabric double bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Bedside Area features a rustic wooden nightstand measuring 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters, providing storage and support for lighting. A modern metal floor lamp, 1.8 meters in height, is suggested for the Lighting Area to ensure adequate lighting for reading. A bohemian-style rug, 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, is recommended for the Rug Area to define the sleeping zone. Finally, contemporary wall art pieces, each 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters, are proposed for the Wall Art Areas to add visual interest without cluttering the space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The fabric double bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and leaves ample space for other furniture, aligning with the user's preference for a classic style and providing a clear view upon entering the room. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The wooden nightstand is positioned to the right of the bed, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy accessibility and maintains a cohesive look with the bed and nightstand together. The nightstand's dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bed without causing spatial conflicts.

The floor lamp is placed to the left of the nightstand, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures it is adjacent to the nightstand, providing optimal lighting for reading without obstructing movement. The lamp's height (1.8m) allows it to illuminate the bedside area effectively, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The rug is centrally placed under the bed, extending beyond the sides to create a defined sleeping area. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) allow it to fit comfortably under the bed without obstructing movement or conflicting with other objects. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic and functional appeal.

Wall art 1 is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it does not conflict with existing objects and complements the room's overall design. Wall art 2 is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, creating a balanced visual aesthetic with wall art 1 on the opposite wall. Both pieces of wall art add visual interest and enhance the room's ambiance without overcrowding the space.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified with the floor lamp being out of bounds when placed to the right of the nightstand. To resolve this, the floor lamp was repositioned to the left of the nightstand, ensuring it remains adjacent and provides optimal lighting without spatial conflicts. Additionally, the nightstand's surface area was too small to accommodate both the floor lamp and the decorative vase. To maintain functionality and aesthetic appeal, the decorative vase was removed, prioritizing the floor lamp for its essential role in providing lighting.
