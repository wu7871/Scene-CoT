## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional laundry room equipped with a white washing machine, a metal drying rack, and storage shelves. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these essential elements. The user prioritizes functionality and efficiency, with specific areas designated for washing, drying, and storage. Additional elements such as a laundry basket, ironing board, and utility cart are suggested to enhance the room's usability and maintain a cohesive aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Washing Area, Drying Area, Storage Area, Laundry Basket Area, Ironing Board Area, and Utility Cart Area. Each substructure serves a specific purpose, ensuring the room remains organized and efficient. The Washing Area is centered around the washing machine, while the Drying Area is designated for the drying rack. The Storage Area is intended for organizing cleaning supplies, and the Laundry Basket Area provides easy access for transferring clothes. The Ironing Board Area offers a dedicated space for ironing, and the Utility Cart Area ensures tools and cleaning products are conveniently located.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Washing Area, a modern white washing machine with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended. The Drying Area features a metal drying rack measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.8 meters. The Storage Area includes a set of modern white storage shelves with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters. A matching laundry basket (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.8 meters) is recommended for the Laundry Basket Area. The Ironing Board Area includes a modern ironing board (1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters) and an iron (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters). Finally, the Utility Cart Area features a modern utility cart (1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.0 meter) for storing cleaning products.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space efficiency and accessibility, allowing for plumbing connections and ease of movement around the room. The washing machine's dimensions (0.8m x 0.6m x 1.2m) fit well against the wall, ensuring it does not block access to other parts of the room. This central placement along the south wall leaves ample room for additional laundry equipment and maintains a balanced aesthetic.

The drying rack is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflict with the washing machine and allows for efficient use of space. The drying rack's dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. This location ensures optimal airflow and lighting conditions for drying clothes.

Storage shelves are placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement avoids conflicts with the washing machine and drying rack, providing easy access for organizing cleaning supplies. The shelves' dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 2.0m) ensure they do not overwhelm the space, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The laundry basket is placed adjacent to the washing machine on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access and reduces walking distance between the washing machine and basket. The basket's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.8m) allow it to fit beside the washing machine without causing spatial conflicts, enhancing the room's functionality.

The ironing board is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it does not obstruct the existing setup and provides a practical location for ironing. The ironing board's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The iron is placed on the ironing board, which is positioned against the north wall. The iron's small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensures it does not occupy much space, and its placement on the ironing board ensures it is easily accessible and functional.

The utility cart is placed against the east wall, left of the drying rack, facing the west wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflict with other objects and provides easy access for storing cleaning products. The cart's dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit alongside the drying rack, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the current layout. All objects are placed in a manner that respects spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing laundry room.
