## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic powder room characterized by a pedestal sink, a framed mirror, and luxurious hand towels. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while ensuring a cohesive and luxurious aesthetic. The user emphasizes a chic style, which necessitates careful selection of materials and colors to maintain a harmonious environment. Additional elements such as a towel rack, lighting fixtures, and a decorative rug are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetics, with a total object count not exceeding twelve to prevent clutter.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Sink Area is designated for the pedestal sink and framed mirror, forming the focal point of the room. The Towel Area is intended for the hand towel rack, ensuring easy access and maintaining the chic aesthetic. The Lighting Area focuses on providing ambient lighting, while the Decorative Area includes a rug to add warmth and texture. Each substructure is designed to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a chic pedestal sink and a matching framed mirror are recommended to form the central focal point. The Towel Area features a luxurious hand towel rack made of soft cotton, complementing the room's aesthetic. A modern light fixture is suggested for the Lighting Area to provide even illumination. Finally, a chic decorative rug is recommended for the Decorative Area to add warmth and texture, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The pedestal sink, a central element of the chic powder room, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it remains the focal point, allowing for optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal. The sink's dimensions are 0.7 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.2 meters in height. Its placement against the wall leaves ample space for other elements like the mirror and towel rack, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The framed mirror, measuring 1.0 meter in length, 0.05 meters in width, and 1.5 meters in height, is centrally placed above the pedestal sink. This positioning ensures functionality and aesthetic coherence, reflecting light and enhancing the room's sense of space. The mirror's chic style complements the pedestal sink, creating a cohesive look.

The hand towel rack, with dimensions of 0.6 meters in length, 0.3 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This location ensures easy access from the pedestal sink while maintaining the room's chic aesthetic. The towel rack is positioned at a comfortable height, avoiding conflict with other objects.

The light fixture, measuring 0.499 meters in length, 0.499 meters in width, and 0.949 meters in height, is centrally placed on the ceiling. This placement provides even illumination throughout the room, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The light fixture's modern style complements the chic theme, adding elegance without overcrowding the space.

The decorative rug, with dimensions of 1.2 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 0.01 meters in height, is placed in the middle of the floor. This central placement ensures it does not obstruct any existing objects while adding warmth and texture to the room. The rug's chic style enhances the overall aesthetic, tying together the various elements of the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space above the pedestal sink, which could not accommodate both the framed mirror and the light fixture. To resolve this, the light fixture was removed, as the framed mirror was deemed more critical to the user's preference for a chic powder room with a pedestal sink and a framed mirror. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal without overcrowding the space.
