## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic powder room characterized by elegance and functionality. Essential elements include a pedestal sink, a framed mirror, and luxurious hand towels. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a cohesive aesthetic with luxurious materials and finishes, aiming for a total of 8 to 10 objects that enhance both functionality and style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The Sink Area is designated for the pedestal sink and framed mirror, creating a focal point. The Towel Area is intended for the luxurious hand towels, ensuring easy access and maintaining the chic aesthetic. Additional areas include the floor space around the sink for plumbing connections and the ceiling for lighting, all contributing to a cohesive and functional design.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a chic pedestal sink and a framed mirror are recommended to create a focal point. The Towel Area features luxurious hand towels to enhance the room's aesthetic. A towel ring is suggested to hold the towels securely. A rug is proposed under the sink to add warmth and texture. A decorative vase is recommended to complement the setup, while a small potted plant adds a touch of nature and freshness. A chandelier is considered for the ceiling to provide ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The pedestal sink, a central element of the chic powder room, is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures stability and accessibility, making it a focal point upon entering the room. The sink's dimensions are 0.6 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height. The framed mirror, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.5 meters, is centrally placed above the sink on the north wall, enhancing the aesthetic and functionality of the room.

Hand towels are placed on the towel ring, which is mounted on the north wall, right of the framed mirror. The hand towels measure 0.7 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.05 meters, and their placement ensures easy access and complements the chic decor. The rug, with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 1.0 meters, is placed under the pedestal sink, adding warmth and texture without obstructing movement.

A decorative vase, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters, is placed on the pedestal sink, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and functionality of the sink area. The potted plant, with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed on the floor against the east wall, adding a decorative touch without obstructing the main functions of the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's dimensions and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional chic powder room.
