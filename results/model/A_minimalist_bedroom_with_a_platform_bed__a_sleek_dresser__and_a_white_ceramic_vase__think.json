## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist bedroom characterized by simplicity and elegance, featuring a platform bed, a sleek dresser, and a white ceramic vase. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on essential furniture pieces that serve specific functions while maintaining a clean and serene environment. Additional elements such as a bedside table, lamp, rug, and wall art are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's minimalist preferences. The Platform Bed Area is designated for rest and sleep, serving as the focal point of the room. The Dresser Area is allocated for clothing storage, ensuring organization and accessibility. The Vase Display Area is intended for aesthetic enhancement, adding a touch of elegance. Additional substructures include a Bedside Area for convenience and a Central Area for a rug to define the space and add warmth.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Platform Bed Area, a minimalist wooden platform bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Dresser Area features a sleek, minimalist wooden dresser measuring 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters. A white ceramic vase, 0.15 meters by 0.15 meters by 0.3 meters, is suggested for the Vase Display Area. A minimalist wooden bedside table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) and a silver metal lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) are recommended for the Bedside Area. A beige wool rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters) is proposed for the Central Area, along with multicolor canvas wall art (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter) for aesthetic enhancement.

## 4. Scene Graph
The platform bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to maximize floor space and maintain a minimalist aesthetic. This central placement ensures the bed remains the focal point while allowing for additional furniture placement. The dresser is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring stability and accessibility without obstructing movement. Its sleek design complements the minimalist theme, and its placement maintains balance and proportion within the room.

The vase is centrally placed on the dresser, facing the west wall, enhancing the dresser's aesthetic without cluttering the space. This placement ensures visibility and accessibility, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion. The bedside table is placed to the right of the platform bed, adjacent to it, facing the north wall. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic alignment, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The lamp is placed on the bedside table, facing the north wall, providing lighting for the bed area. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic coherence, enhancing the room's minimalist style. The rug is centrally placed under the platform bed, defining the sleeping area and adding warmth. Its beige color complements the minimalist aesthetic, enhancing the room's functionality and visual appeal.

Wall art is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring visibility and aesthetic balance without obstructing other objects. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic appeal, contributing to the overall minimalist theme.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited length of the north wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. Specifically, the nightstand and mirror were identified as conflicting objects. To resolve this, both the nightstand and mirror were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a minimalist bedroom with a platform bed, dresser, and vase. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing without overcrowding.
