## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy reading nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a cushioned window seat, a tall bookcase, and a warm throw blanket. The user emphasizes comfort and accessibility, suggesting additional items such as a side table, a floor lamp for lighting, and decorative elements like cushions or pillows to enhance the seating area. The aesthetic leans towards a rustic style, with a preference for natural materials and warm tones to create a inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Window Seat Area is designated for comfortable seating and potentially displaying decorative items. Adjacent to this is the Bookcase Area, intended for storing books and enhancing the room's functionality. The Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination for reading, while the Decorative Area includes elements like cushions and pillows to add comfort and visual warmth. Each substructure is designed to contribute to the overall cozy and functional reading nook.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Window Seat Area, a rustic-style cushioned window seat with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter is recommended. The Bookcase Area features a tall, rustic bookcase measuring 2.5 meters by 0.5 meter by 2.0 meters, providing ample space for books. A woolen throw blanket, 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters, is suggested for warmth and comfort. A rustic side table (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters) is recommended for holding items like books or a cup of coffee. A floor lamp (1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters) is proposed to offer lighting, while a cushion (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) is suggested to enhance the seating comfort.

## 4. Scene Graph
The cushioned window seat is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning creates a cozy reading nook by utilizing the wall for support and maximizing window exposure, which is ideal for a reading nook. The seat's rustic style and brown color complement the natural ambiance, and its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall without crowding the room. The placement leaves ample space for additional objects like the bookcase and throw blanket, maintaining balance and proportion.

Adjacent to the window seat, the throw blanket is draped over the seat, adding warmth and texture. This placement ensures the blanket enhances the seating area without cluttering the room, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy reading nook. The blanket's earthy tones harmonize with the rustic theme, and its dimensions (1.5m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably on the seat without causing spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of multiple objects on the window seat, specifically the bookcase, side table, and floor lamp. The window seat's area was insufficient to accommodate all these items simultaneously. To resolve this, the side table, floor lamp, and bookcase were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a cozy reading nook with a cushioned window seat and a warm throw blanket. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's vision.
