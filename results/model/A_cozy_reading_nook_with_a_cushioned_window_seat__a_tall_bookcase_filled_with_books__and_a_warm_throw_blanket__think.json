## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy reading nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a cushioned window seat, a tall bookcase, and a warm throw blanket. The user emphasizes comfort and a cohesive aesthetic, suggesting additional items such as a side table, a floor lamp for lighting, and decorative cushions to enhance the seating area. The design should maintain a cozy atmosphere while ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Window Seat Area is designated for comfortable seating and views, featuring a cushioned window seat and throw blanket. Adjacent to this is the Bookcase Area, which houses a tall bookcase to store books. The Lighting and Comfort Area includes a floor lamp to provide ambient lighting, enhancing the reading experience. Additional decorative elements like cushions are considered to add comfort and style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Window Seat Area, a cozy cushioned window seat (1.5m x 0.8m x 1.0m) is recommended, complemented by a warm throw blanket (1.8m x 1.2m x 0.3m) to add texture and color. The Bookcase Area features a classic-style bookcase (1.2m x 0.4m x 2.0m) to display books. A modern floor lamp (0.613m x 0.613m x 1.944m) is suggested for the Lighting and Comfort Area to provide necessary illumination. Decorative cushions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) are recommended to enhance the window seat's comfort and style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The cushioned window seat is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to create a cozy reading nook. This positioning ensures optimal use of space and provides a view out the window, aligning with the user's vision. The seat's dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 1.0m) fit comfortably along the wall, leaving ample room for other elements. The throw blanket is draped over the window seat, adding warmth and texture without occupying additional floor space. Its dimensions (1.8m x 1.2m x 0.3m) allow it to fit comfortably over the seat, enhancing the aesthetic.

The bookcase is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring stability and accessibility from the window seat. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 2.0m) allow it to fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. This placement ensures easy access to books while seated on the window seat. The floor lamp is positioned to the left of the window seat, facing the east wall, to provide optimal lighting for reading. Its compact size (0.613m x 0.613m x 1.944m) ensures it does not obstruct the view or interfere with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the east wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. Specifically, the side table and cushions were identified as conflicting with the existing window seat, bookcase, and throw blanket. To resolve this, the side table and cushions were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a cozy reading nook with a cushioned window seat, tall bookcase, and warm throw blanket. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal without overcrowding the space.
