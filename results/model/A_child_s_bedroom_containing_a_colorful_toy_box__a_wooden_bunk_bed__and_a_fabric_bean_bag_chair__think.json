## 4. Scene Graph
The toy box is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space efficiency and provides easy access for a child, aligning with the room's playful theme. The toy box's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The bunk bed is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement allows for easy access and visibility from the room's center, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal. The bunk bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 2.0m) ensure it does not obstruct access to other elements, such as the toy box, and maintains a balanced layout.

The bean bag chair is centrally located in the room, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it does not conflict with the bunk bed or toy box, providing a central, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing location. The bean bag's dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle of the room, enhancing the room's playful and vibrant atmosphere.

The rug is placed under the bean bag chair, defining the seating area. The rug's dimensions (1.5m x 1.5m) fit well under the bean bag, enhancing comfort and visual appeal without conflicting with other objects in the room.

The desk is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures it is out of the way of major traffic areas and complements the existing room layout. The desk's dimensions (1.0m x 0.6m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall, providing a functional workspace for arts and crafts.

The chair is placed in front of the desk, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it is adjacent to the desk, facilitating arts and crafts activities. The chair's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably in front of the desk, maintaining a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout.

The nightstand is placed to the right of the bunk bed, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it is adjacent to the bunk bed, providing easy access for a child using the bed. The nightstand's dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 1.0m) fit comfortably next to the bunk bed, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The lamp is placed on the nightstand, facing the east wall. This placement ensures it provides lighting for the bunk bed area without obstructing movement or view. The lamp's dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably on the nightstand, providing necessary lighting while maintaining the room's playful theme.

Wall art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures it is visible and enhances the room's aesthetic without conflicting with other objects. The wall art's dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) allow it to be a prominent feature without overwhelming the space, adding vibrancy and creativity to the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional layout. The room's playful theme is maintained throughout, with each object contributing to the overall design and functionality.

## 6. Object Placement
For toy_box_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with no child
        - calculation:
            - toy_box_1 has no child, so no rotation difference calculation needed.
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation required.
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'south_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - toy_box_1 size: length=1.2, width=0.8, height=1.0
            - Cluster size: {'left of': 0.0, 'right of': 0.0, 'behind': 0.0, 'in front': 0.0}
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied.
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - South_wall position: x=2.5, y=0, z=1.5
            - toy_box_1 size: length=1.2, width=0.8, height=1.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.2/2 = 0.6
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.2/2 = 4.4
            - y_min = y_max = 0.4
            - z_min = z_max = 0.5
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.6, 4.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.5, 0.5)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.6-4.4), y(0.4-0.4)
        - conclusion: Valid placement boundaries confirmed.
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects present for collision check.
        - conclusion: No collision detected.
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=3.3118, y=0.4, z=0.5
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.3118, y: 0.4, z: 0.5
