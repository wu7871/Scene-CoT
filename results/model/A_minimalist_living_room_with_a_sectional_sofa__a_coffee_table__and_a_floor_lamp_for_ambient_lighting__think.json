## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living room characterized by a sectional sofa, a coffee table, and a floor lamp, all contributing to a serene and uncluttered environment. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a minimalist aesthetic, which prioritizes simplicity and functionality, avoiding decorative elements that could detract from the room's clean lines and open feel. The sectional sofa is intended to provide comfortable seating while maintaining the minimalist style, the coffee table is central to the room's function, and the floor lamp is crucial for providing ambient lighting without disrupting the minimalist design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The Sectional Sofa Area is designated for the main seating arrangement, providing comfort and support while adhering to the minimalist style. The Coffee Table Area is centrally located, serving as a focal point for the room's functionality and aesthetic. The Floor Lamp Area is positioned to offer ambient lighting, enhancing the room's ambiance without cluttering the space. Additional areas include potential spaces for decorative cushions or throws to add subtle texture and color, as well as wall art to introduce a personal touch.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sectional Sofa Area, a minimalist leather sectional sofa measuring 3.5 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended, providing ample seating without unnecessary decorative elements. The Coffee Table Area features a minimalist glass coffee table (1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.45 meters) that complements the sectional sofa and enhances the room's aesthetic. A floor lamp made of metal, measuring 1.8 meters in height, is suggested for the Floor Lamp Area to provide ambient lighting. Additional recommendations include minimalist decorative cushions (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) to add subtle texture and color, and a piece of wall art (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) to enhance the room's decor without cluttering it.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional sofa, a central element of the minimalist living room, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and provides an unobstructed view throughout the room, aligning with the minimalist aesthetic of simplicity and openness. The sofa's dimensions (3.5m x 2.0m x 0.9m) fit comfortably along the south wall, leaving ample space for other furniture and ensuring easy movement around the room.

The coffee table is centrally located in front of the sectional sofa, facing the north wall. This placement ensures accessibility from the sofa and maintains the minimalist aesthetic by keeping the room simple and organized. The coffee table's dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.45m) allow it to fit seamlessly between the sectional sofa and other potential seating arrangements, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the sectional sofa, facing the north wall. This positioning provides ambient lighting to the seating area without obstructing the view or use of other objects. The lamp's height (1.8m) ensures it does not overwhelm the space, complementing the minimalist design and providing necessary lighting without cluttering the room.

Decorative cushion 1 is placed on the sectional sofa, providing subtle texture and color without disrupting the minimalist aesthetic. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) fit well on the sofa, adding a soft texture that enhances the seating area's comfort and aesthetic appeal.

Wall art 1 is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it is visible from the sectional sofa and does not interfere with the floor lamp or coffee table. The wall art's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) make it suitable for adding a personal touch without cluttering the space, enhancing the room's decor and maintaining the minimalist theme.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of decorative cushion 2, which could not be positioned left of decorative cushion 1 due to the presence of the sectional sofa. Additionally, decorative cushion 2 could not be placed behind decorative cushion 1 for the same reason. To resolve these conflicts, both decorative cushion 1 and decorative cushion 2 were removed, as they were deemed less critical compared to the sectional sofa, coffee table, and floor lamp, which are essential for achieving the minimalist living room aesthetic.
