## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living room characterized by a sectional sofa, a coffee table, and a floor lamp, all contributing to a serene and uncluttered aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a minimalist style, focusing on simplicity and open space, with a preference for natural materials and neutral tones. Additional elements such as cushions, a rug, wall art, and a side table are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetics while maintaining the minimalist theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to fulfill the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the sectional sofa, serving as the main seating area. Adjacent to this is the Coffee Table Area, which provides a surface for drinks and decor. The Lighting Area focuses on the floor lamp, offering ambient lighting. The Decor Area includes wall art and a rug to add visual interest without cluttering the space. Lastly, the Side Table Area is intended for additional surface support near the sectional sofa.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sectional Sofa Area, a minimalist sectional sofa in beige fabric is recommended, providing ample seating and maintaining a cohesive look. The Coffee Table Area features a glass coffee table, complementing the sectional sofa and enhancing the minimalist aesthetic. A brass floor lamp is suggested for the Lighting Area, positioned to the left of the sectional sofa to provide optimal lighting. Wall art and a rug are proposed for the Decor Area, adding visual interest without disrupting the minimalist style. A side table is also recommended for holding items near the sectional sofa.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional sofa, a central element of the minimalist living room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space efficiency and maintains an open feel, allowing the sofa to serve as a focal point while leaving ample room for other furniture. The sofa's dimensions are 4.0 meters in length, 2.0 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, fitting well against the wall and leaving space for additional furniture in front and to the sides.

The coffee table, measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.45 meters, is centrally placed in front of the sectional sofa. This positioning ensures easy access and interaction with the sofa, adhering to the minimalist aesthetic by maintaining balance and proportion without overcrowding the space.

The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters, is placed to the left of the sectional sofa, facing the east wall. This placement provides optimal lighting to the seating area without obstructing the view or movement, complementing the minimalist style with its industrial-style lampshade.

Wall art, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it does not interfere with other objects and adds a decorative touch to the room, enhancing the minimalist aesthetic.

The rug, measuring 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed under the coffee table and in front of the sectional sofa. This placement enhances the aesthetic appeal and functionality of the living room, providing a cohesive and balanced design.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the north wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The side table and plant were identified as conflicting with the sectional sofa's placement. To resolve this, both the side table and plant were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a minimalist living room with a sectional sofa, coffee table, and floor lamp. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the minimalist theme.
