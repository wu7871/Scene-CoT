## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy den characterized by a warm and inviting atmosphere, featuring a fabric recliner, a wooden bookshelf, and a woven blanket. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a rustic aesthetic, emphasizing comfort and accessibility, with a focus on creating a reading nook that includes adequate lighting and storage for books. Additional recommendations include a side table, floor lamp, rug, decorative throw, and artwork to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Reclining Area is designated for the fabric recliner, serving as the focal point for relaxation. The Bookshelf Area is intended for storing books, providing easy access and visual interest. The Reading Nook is created by combining the recliner and bookshelf, enhanced by a rug and decorative elements to define the space. The Lighting Area focuses on ensuring adequate illumination for reading, while the Decorative Area includes artwork to add personality and warmth to the den.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Reclining Area, a rustic fabric recliner in beige is recommended for its comfort and aesthetic fit. The Bookshelf Area features a rustic wooden bookshelf, providing both storage and a focal point. A woven blanket is suggested to add warmth and texture to the Reading Nook. A rustic side table complements the furniture, offering a surface for books or drinks. A floor lamp is recommended to provide focused lighting for reading, while a rug defines the space and adds warmth. Decorative elements include a throw and artwork to enhance the room's rustic charm.

## 4. Scene Graph
The recliner, a central piece for comfort and style, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it does not block pathways and allows for optimal lighting, making it a cozy reading spot. The recliner's dimensions are 1.073 meters in length, 0.853 meters in width, and 0.971 meters in height, fitting well against the wall and leaving ample space for other elements.

The bookshelf, with dimensions of 1.2 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 2.0 meters in height, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning provides balance and symmetry, allowing easy access from the recliner and avoiding obstruction of views or pathways. The bookshelf enhances the room's rustic and cozy ambiance.

The blanket, measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.1 meter, is draped over the recliner, adding warmth and texture. This placement ensures the blanket serves its functional purpose while enhancing the aesthetic of the cozy den.

The side table, with dimensions of 0.75 meters by 0.75 meters by 0.85 meters, is placed to the right of the recliner, adjacent to it. This placement ensures easy access and maintains the room's aesthetic and functional flow, complementing the rustic theme.

The floor lamp, standing 1.8 meters tall, is placed to the left of the recliner, providing optimal lighting for the reading area without obstructing views or access to other elements. This placement ensures the lamp complements the room's cozy den setup.

The rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed under the recliner and side table, defining the reading nook and adding warmth to the space. It is oriented parallel to the longer walls, enhancing the room's aesthetic and functional design.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional cozy den environment.
