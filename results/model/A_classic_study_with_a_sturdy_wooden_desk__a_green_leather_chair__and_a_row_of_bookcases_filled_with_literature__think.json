## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room characterized by a robust wooden desk, a green leather chair, and a row of bookcases filled with literature. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while ensuring a cohesive aesthetic. The primary focus is on creating a functional workspace with adequate lighting and storage, complemented by classic decor elements such as a rug, wall sconces, and a clock. The user prefers a classic style, emphasizing durability and elegance in furniture and materials.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Bookcase Area along the north wall provides storage for books, contributing to the classic aesthetic. The Study Area is centered around the wooden desk and leather chair, forming the primary workspace. The Lighting Area includes wall sconces to enhance visibility and ambiance. Additionally, a central Rug Area defines the workspace, while a Clock Area on the east wall adds a touch of classic elegance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, two classic-style bookcases made of dark wood are recommended to store books and enhance the room's aesthetic. The Study Area features a sturdy wooden desk and a green leather chair, essential for the room's function. A classic brass desk lamp is suggested to provide focused lighting on the desk. The Lighting Area includes two classic-style wall sconces to illuminate the room effectively. A wool rug in burgundy color is recommended for the Rug Area, adding warmth and texture. Finally, a classic-style clock is proposed for the Clock Area to complete the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk, a central piece in the study, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures stability and allows for optimal lighting from a potential window on the north wall, enhancing the workspace. The desk's dimensions are 1.8 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.9 meters in height, fitting well against the wall and leaving ample space for other elements.

The green leather chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic coherence, with the chair's dimensions of 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.2 meters allowing it to fit comfortably in front of the desk without obstructing pathways.

The first bookcase, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.5 meters, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location provides balance and symmetry to the room, with the bookcase's height and classic style complementing the existing furnishings.

The second bookcase, identical in style and dimensions to the first, is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This symmetrical arrangement enhances the room's aesthetic and functionality, with both bookcases storing books and balancing the room's visual weight.

The desk lamp, with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed on the desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the lamp provides effective lighting for the desk area without causing spatial conflicts.

The rug, measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is centrally placed under the desk and chair, defining the workspace. Its burgundy color adds warmth and complements the existing decor, with dimensions of 0.02 meters in height.

The wall sconce on the north wall, measuring 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed high on the wall to provide ambient lighting. This placement ensures it does not interfere with floor space or other objects, enhancing the room's classic ambiance.

The wall sconce on the south wall is symmetrically placed to provide balanced lighting. With dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, it faces the north wall, ensuring consistent illumination throughout the room.

The clock, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed on the east wall above the second bookcase, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it is visible from the desk area, enhancing the room's classic and functional design.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the plant, which could not be positioned left of the bookcase due to the presence of the desk. To resolve this, the plant was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the bookcase, which is essential for the user's vision of a classic study room. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic integrity.
