## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room characterized by a sturdy wooden desk, a green leather chair, and a row of bookcases filled with literature. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing environment conducive to reading and study. The user prefers a classic style, emphasizing the need for stability and comfort, particularly with the desk and chair, while also highlighting the importance of adequate lighting and a cohesive color scheme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to fulfill the user's requirements. The Bookcase Area is designated along the east wall for storing books. The Study Area is centrally located, featuring the wooden desk and leather chair. The Lighting Area focuses on ensuring adequate illumination for reading, primarily through a floor lamp placed near the desk. Additional elements such as a rug under the desk area, a wall clock for time management, and decorative items like a globe or painting are considered to enhance the room's classic aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, classic-style bookcases made of dark wood are recommended to store a variety of literature. The Study Area features a sturdy wooden desk and a green leather chair, both essential for the room's function and style. A classic brass floor lamp is suggested to provide focused lighting on the desk. A burgundy wool rug is proposed to add warmth and texture under the desk area. A gold metal wall clock is recommended for time management, while a blue canvas painting adds visual interest. A red glass paperweight enhances the desk's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk, a central piece in the classic study, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures it does not obstruct access to other elements like the bookcases or create clutter. The desk's dimensions are 1.8 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.9 meters in height. Its placement leaves ample space around it for other furniture, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The green leather chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures optimal functionality and aesthetic alignment with the user's vision. The chair's dimensions are 0.8 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 1.2 meters in height, fitting comfortably in front of the desk without causing spatial conflicts.

The bookcase, measuring 2.0 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 2.5 meters in height, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location keeps the room balanced and ensures easy access from the desk, enhancing the study's functionality and classic style.

The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.6 meters in length, 0.6 meters in width, and 1.9 meters in height, is placed to the right of the desk, facing the south wall. This positioning provides direct lighting towards the desk area without obstructing the view or movement, complementing the classic study theme.

The rug, measuring 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, is placed under the desk and chair, anchoring them together and adding warmth to the room. The rug's burgundy color complements the green leather chair and enhances the classic study theme.

The wall clock, with dimensions of 0.5 meters in length, 0.1 meters in width, and 0.5 meters in height, is centrally placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures visibility from the desk area, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The painting, measuring 1.0 meter in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 1.5 meters in height, is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement adds visual interest without overwhelming the space, complementing the existing classic decor.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically placed to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain the room's classic aesthetic and functional requirements. The arrangement ensures a cohesive and balanced study environment, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles.
