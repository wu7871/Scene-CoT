## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a sunroom characterized by natural light, relaxation, and aesthetic appeal. Essential elements include a wicker chaise lounge, a ceramic plant pot, and a small round table. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional objects to enhance functionality and aesthetics. The user prefers a bohemian style with natural materials, emphasizing comfort and visual harmony.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the chaise lounge, serving as the primary relaxation zone. The east wall is allocated for the plant pot, adding greenery and enhancing the natural ambiance. The south wall is reserved for decorative elements like wall art, contributing to the room's aesthetic. Additional substructures include spaces for a floor lamp to provide ambient lighting and a rug to define the relaxation area.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central relaxation area, a bohemian-style wicker chaise lounge is recommended, measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter. A small round table, also in bohemian style, complements the chaise lounge, enhancing the relaxation setup. A ceramic plant pot adds natural decor, while bohemian-style wall art on the east wall enhances the aesthetic. A floor lamp provides ambient lighting, and a bohemian-style rug defines the relaxation zone.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wicker chaise lounge is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to maximize exposure to sunlight and maintain balance and proportion. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 1.0m) allow it to serve as the focal point for relaxation, ensuring no spatial conflicts with other intended objects. The placement aligns with the user's vision for a bright sunroom, optimizing sunlight exposure and maintaining open space for additional furniture.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space available for the small round table, which could not accommodate both the floor lamp and the ceramic plant pot. To resolve this, the floor lamp and ceramic plant pot were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a bright sunroom with a wicker chaise lounge and small round table. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a harmonious and open environment.
