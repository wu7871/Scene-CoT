## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a charming breakfast nook within a 5.0m x 5.0m room, emphasizing a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Key elements include a small round table, wooden dining chairs, and a woven basket centerpiece. The user prefers a rustic aesthetic, focusing on creating a warm and intimate dining area that facilitates conversation and enjoyment of morning meals. Additional elements such as a rug, wall art, and a ceiling light fixture are suggested to enhance the room's warmth and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the Dining Area, featuring the round table and chairs. The South Wall Area is reserved for decorative elements like wall art, enhancing the room's rustic charm. The Ceiling Area is allocated for lighting, ensuring adequate illumination for dining activities. These substructures collectively support the overall theme and functionality of the breakfast nook.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a rustic-style round table with dimensions of 1.2m x 1.2m x 0.75m is recommended, accompanied by four rustic wooden chairs, each measuring 0.65m x 0.65m x 1.0m. A woven basket, serving as a centerpiece, adds a natural touch. A bohemian-style rug (2.0m x 2.0m) is suggested to define the dining area. The South Wall Area features multicolor wall art (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) to enhance the rustic theme. A modern metal ceiling light (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) provides ambient lighting, ensuring the room remains inviting and functional.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point of the breakfast nook. Its rustic style and natural wood color complement the desired aesthetic, while its central placement ensures balance and proportion, allowing easy access from all sides. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 1.2m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, providing ample space for interaction and movement.

Chair_1 is positioned behind the round table, facing the north wall, ensuring functional seating and maintaining visual harmony. This placement allows for easy conversation and dining, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion. Chair_2 is placed to the right of the round table, facing the west wall, creating a balanced setup around the table. Chair_3 is positioned to the left of the round table, facing the east wall, maintaining symmetry and accessibility. Chair_4 is placed in front of the round table, facing the south wall, completing the symmetrical arrangement around the table and ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The woven basket is centrally placed on the round table, serving as a decorative centerpiece. Its rustic style and natural materials enhance the table's aesthetic, adding a tactile element to the dining area. The rug is placed under the round table and chairs, defining the dining area and tying the furniture together visually. It is centered under the table, with its pattern oriented to complement the room's aesthetic.

Wall_art_1 is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring visibility and enhancing the room's aesthetic without obstructing movement or sightlines. The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing even illumination across the room. This placement avoids obstruction by floor-based objects and complements the rustic theme, ensuring functionality and aesthetic coherence.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional breakfast nook.
