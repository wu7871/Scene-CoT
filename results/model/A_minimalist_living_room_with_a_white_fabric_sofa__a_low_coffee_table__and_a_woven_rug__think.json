## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living room characterized by simplicity and elegance, focusing on a white fabric sofa, a low coffee table, and a woven rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a serene and calming atmosphere, with a preference for a cohesive color palette and functional yet aesthetically pleasing furniture. Additional elements such as cushions, a floor lamp, wall art, and a decorative plant are suggested to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Sofa Area is designated for the white fabric sofa, providing a comfortable seating zone. The Coffee Table Area is centrally located to serve as a functional surface for beverages and decor. The Rug Area defines the seating zone, adding texture and warmth. Additional areas include a Lighting Zone for ambient illumination, an Art Display Zone for wall art, and a Decorative Zone for enhancing the room's aesthetic with plants and cushions.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Area, a minimalist white fabric sofa measuring 2.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.8 meters is recommended. The Coffee Table Area features a minimalist glass coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.45 meters) to complement the sofa. A beige woven rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) is suggested for the Rug Area. A silver metal floor lamp (0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters) provides lighting, while multicolor canvas wall art (1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.0 meter) adds visual interest. A green ceramic decorative plant (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.5 meters) enhances the room's natural ambiance, along with blue cotton cushions (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) for added comfort.

## 4. Scene Graph
The white fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and maintains the minimalist aesthetic, ensuring balance and proportion without obstructing pathways. The coffee table is positioned directly in front of the sofa, centrally aligned for optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal. Its transparent material ensures it does not visually clutter the space. The woven rug is placed under the coffee table, defining the seating area and enhancing the room's texture without causing spatial conflicts. The floor lamp is placed to the right of the sofa, providing ambient lighting without obstructing the view or movement. Wall art is centered above the sofa on the east wall, adding visual interest without overwhelming the minimalist style. Cushions are placed on the sofa, enhancing comfort and aesthetic appeal without disrupting the minimalist theme. The decorative plant is placed on the floor near the east wall, adding greenery without obstructing movement or sight lines.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically placed to maintain the minimalist aesthetic and functionality of the living room, ensuring a cohesive and serene environment.
