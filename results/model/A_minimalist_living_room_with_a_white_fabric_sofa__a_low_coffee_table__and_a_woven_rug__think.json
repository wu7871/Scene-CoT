## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living room characterized by a white fabric sofa, a low coffee table, and a woven rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on simplicity and functionality, with a preference for natural materials and a cohesive color palette. Additional seating options such as armchairs are considered, but they should maintain the minimalist style and not clutter the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the white fabric sofa, which serves as the main seating element. Adjacent to this is the low coffee table, providing a surface for drinks and decor. The woven rug is intended to define the seating area, adding warmth and texture. Additional seating is considered for balance and functionality, ensuring the room remains uncluttered and maintains its minimalist aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central seating area, a minimalist white fabric sofa measuring 3.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.8 meters is recommended. A minimalist low coffee table, 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.45 meters, complements the sofa. A beige woven rug, 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, defines the seating area. Additional recommendations include minimalist armchairs and a floor lamp to enhance lighting and seating flexibility, all adhering to the minimalist style and maintaining functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The white fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and leaves ample space in the middle of the room for the coffee table and rug, aligning with the minimalist aesthetic. The sofa's dimensions (3.0m x 1.0m x 0.8m) fit well against the wall, providing a clear view across the room and leaving the central area open for other elements.

The woven rug is centrally placed under the coffee table, defining the seating area and providing visual cohesion. The rug's dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably under the coffee table without overlapping other furniture, enhancing the minimalist design by balancing the layout.

The coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, centrally located in the room. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.5m x 0.45m) ensure it fits well without causing spatial conflicts, creating a cohesive seating arrangement that supports the minimalist aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate the sofa, rug, and coffee table simultaneously. To resolve this, the rug and coffee table were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a minimalist living room with a white fabric sofa. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic, ensuring a clear and open layout.

## 6. Object Placement
For sofa_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with south_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of sofa_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of south_wall: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'south_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - sofa_1 size: 3.0 (length)
            - Cluster size (south_wall): max(0.0, 3.0) = 3.0
        - conclusion: sofa_1 cluster size (south_wall): 3.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - sofa_1 size: length=3.0, width=1.0, height=0.8
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 3.0/2 = 1.5
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 3.0/2 = 3.5
            - y_min = 0 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 0 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - z_min = z_max = 0.8/2 = 0.4
        - conclusion: Possible position: (1.5, 3.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4, 0.4)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(1.5-3.5), y(0.5-0.5)
            - Final coordinates: x=2.228, y=0.5, z=0.4
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.228, y: 0.5, z: 0.4
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects present for collision check
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=2.228, y=0.5, z=0.4
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.228, y: 0.5, z: 0.4
