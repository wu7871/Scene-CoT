## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional home office that incorporates specific furniture pieces such as a wooden desk, a leather upholstered swivel chair, and a black metal filing cabinet. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these items. The primary focus is on creating a workspace that is both efficient and aesthetically pleasing, with additional elements like a rug, wall art, and a plant suggested to enhance the room's warmth and comfort. The user also expressed interest in adding a desk lamp and a monitor to support work activities.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the desk and chair setup, forming the core of the home office. Adjacent to this is the filing cabinet area, which provides storage while maintaining accessibility. The east wall is reserved for wall art and a plant, adding aesthetic value and warmth to the space. Additional elements like a rug and a desk lamp are strategically placed to enhance the overall functionality and aesthetic of the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central workspace, a classic wooden desk and a leather upholstered swivel chair are recommended to create a cohesive and functional setup. A modern black metal filing cabinet is suggested for storing office supplies. To enhance the ambiance, contemporary wall art and a plant are proposed for the east wall. A minimalist grey rug is recommended to add texture and warmth under the desk area. A modern desk lamp and a monitor are also included to improve lighting and support work activities.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk, a central element of the home office, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space usage and creates a functional workspace, aligning with the user's preference for a classic style. The desk's dimensions are 1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters, fitting comfortably against the wall and leaving ample space for other furniture.

The leather upholstered swivel chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures ergonomic seating and complements the desk's orientation, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. The chair's dimensions are 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters, allowing it to fit seamlessly in front of the desk without spatial conflicts.

The black metal filing cabinet is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This location ensures accessibility from the desk without obstructing the chair's movement, maintaining an open and functional workspace. The filing cabinet's dimensions are 0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.8 meters, fitting well along the wall and complementing the desk and chair arrangement.

The wall art is centrally placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement avoids spatial conflicts with existing furniture and adds visual interest without cluttering the room. The wall art's dimensions are 1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters, making it suitable for wall display.

The plant is placed on the floor against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic without obstructing functional areas. The plant's dimensions are 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.5 meters, ensuring it fits comfortably against the wall.

The rug is centrally placed under the desk, oriented parallel to the room's dimensions. This placement enhances the aesthetic appeal and provides a cohesive look to the workspace. The rug's dimensions are 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.01 meters, fitting comfortably under the desk area without overlapping other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the desk lamp initially intended to be placed on the desk. The width of the desk was too small to accommodate the lamp without causing spatial issues. To resolve this, the desk lamp was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the other elements specified by the user, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.
