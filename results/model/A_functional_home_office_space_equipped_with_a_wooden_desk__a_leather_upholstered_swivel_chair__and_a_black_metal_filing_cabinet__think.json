## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional home office that includes a wooden desk, a leather upholstered swivel chair, and a black metal filing cabinet. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a professional and organized atmosphere, with a focus on ergonomic design and efficient workflow. Additional items such as a computer monitor, desk lamp, and rug are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Desk Area is designated for the wooden desk and related office equipment, ensuring ergonomic alignment and efficient workflow. The Seating Area focuses on comfort and support with the leather swivel chair. The Storage Area is allocated for the filing cabinet, providing necessary storage solutions. The Lighting Area includes the desk lamp to ensure adequate illumination. Lastly, the Aesthetic Area is enhanced with a rug to add warmth and texture.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk Area, a classic wooden desk measuring 1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, along with a modern black metal desk lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) to provide focused lighting. The Seating Area features a classic leather upholstered swivel chair (0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters) for comfort. The Storage Area includes a modern black metal filing cabinet (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters) for organizing documents. A contemporary blue rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it is a central element of the home office setup. This placement ensures stability and allows for ergonomic use, leaving ample space for other furniture. The desk's dimensions (1.8m x 0.9m x 0.75m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The leather upholstered swivel chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures functional and aesthetic harmony, allowing the user to sit comfortably while working at the desk. The chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably in front of the desk without crowding the room.

The black metal filing cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures accessibility from the desk while maintaining an open and functional workspace. The cabinet's dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall without interfering with other furniture.

The desk lamp is placed on the right side of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement provides optimal lighting for the desk area without obstructing the view or function of other objects. The lamp's dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably on the desk without causing spatial conflicts.

The rug is centrally placed under the desk and chair, enhancing the room's aesthetic without disrupting functionality. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably under the desk and chair arrangement, adding warmth and texture to the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of multiple objects on the desk, specifically the computer monitor and the desk lamp. The desk's area was insufficient to accommodate both the desk lamp and the computer monitor. To resolve this, the computer monitor was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the desk lamp, which provides essential lighting for the workspace. This decision maintained the room's functionality and adhered to the user's preference for a functional home office space.
