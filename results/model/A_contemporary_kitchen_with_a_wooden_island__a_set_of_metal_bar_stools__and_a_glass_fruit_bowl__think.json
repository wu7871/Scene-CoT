## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary kitchen characterized by a minimalist aesthetic with a focus on functionality. Key elements include a wooden island, metal bar stools, and a glass fruit bowl. The kitchen should facilitate social interaction and efficient cooking, with a cohesive color scheme and harmonious materials. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a modern style, emphasizing the need for a central gathering point around the island, comfortable seating, and a focal point with the fruit bowl.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Central Gathering Point is defined by the wooden island, serving as the focal area for interaction. The Seating Area surrounds the island, featuring metal bar stools for comfort and style. The Decorative Area includes the placement of a glass fruit bowl on the island to add elegance and freshness. Additionally, the Kitchen Functionality Area ensures the kitchen remains practical and efficient, with proper lighting and ventilation.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Gathering Point, a contemporary wooden island measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Seating Area includes three metal bar stools, each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, providing ergonomic seating. The Decorative Area features a glass fruit bowl (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters) to enhance the aesthetic. Additional recommendations include a modern ceiling light (0.694 meters by 0.694 meters by 1.13 meters) for illumination and a ventilation system for air circulation.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden island is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the main gathering point. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle, ensuring accessibility from all sides and aligning with the user's vision of a contemporary kitchen. This central placement adheres to design principles of balance and proportion, enhancing the kitchen's aesthetic and functional appeal.

Bar_stool_1 is positioned to the right of the island, facing the west wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflict with the island and provides a balanced layout, allowing for comfortable seating and interaction with the kitchen's central feature. Bar_stool_2 is placed to the left of the island, facing the east wall, creating symmetry and maintaining functionality. Bar_stool_3 is positioned in front of the island, facing the south wall, completing the symmetrical arrangement around the island and ensuring easy access and visual coherence.

The fruit bowl is placed on top of the island, serving as a decorative centerpiece. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.2m) allows it to fit without obstructing the stools or other elements, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the kitchen.

The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, directly above the island, to provide even illumination across the kitchen. Its dimensions (0.694m x 0.694m x 1.13m) ensure it does not interfere with floor-standing objects, maintaining the room's contemporary style and functionality.

The ventilation system is placed on the ceiling, towards the east wall, ensuring optimal air circulation without obstructing other objects. Its placement complements the ceiling light, maintaining a balanced distribution of fixtures and contributing to the room's overall aesthetic and functionality.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the current layout. All objects are placed in a manner that avoids spatial conflicts and adheres to the user's preferences and design principles. The arrangement ensures a cohesive and functional kitchen environment, with each element contributing to the overall aesthetic and functionality.
