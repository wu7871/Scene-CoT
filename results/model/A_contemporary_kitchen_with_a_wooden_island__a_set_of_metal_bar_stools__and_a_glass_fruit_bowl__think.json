## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary kitchen featuring a wooden island, metal bar stools, and a glass fruit bowl. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a modern aesthetic with a focus on functionality and style, aiming for a kitchen that balances these aspects effectively. Additional elements such as lighting fixtures, a kitchen backsplash, and a refrigerator are suggested to enhance both the functionality and aesthetic of the kitchen.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Central Cooking Area is designated for the wooden island, serving as the focal point for cooking and dining. The Seating Area surrounds the island, accommodating bar stools for casual dining. The Display Area includes the placement of a glass fruit bowl on the island to add a touch of elegance. The Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination over the island and throughout the kitchen. Additionally, a Kitchen Appliance Area is identified for the refrigerator, ensuring easy access and functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Cooking Area, a contemporary wooden island measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Seating Area features three modern metal bar stools, each measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meter, to provide comfortable seating. The Display Area includes a contemporary glass fruit bowl with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.15 meters. To enhance the Lighting Area, a modern metal lighting fixture with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters is suggested. A minimalist ceramic kitchen backsplash measuring 5.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter is also recommended for aesthetic enhancement.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden island is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. This central placement ensures accessibility from all sides, allowing for optimal use of bar stools and enhancing the kitchen's functionality. The island's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) fit well within the room, providing ample space for movement and interaction. Its natural wood color complements the contemporary kitchen theme, and its central alignment ensures balance and proportion.

Bar stool 1 is positioned to the right of the island, facing the west wall. This placement provides a direct view across the kitchen, enhancing the social aspect of dining. The stool's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the island without causing spatial conflicts. Bar stool 2 is placed to the left of the island, facing the east wall, ensuring symmetry and balance in the seating arrangement. Bar stool 3 is positioned behind the island, facing the north wall, completing the circular seating arrangement around the island.

The glass fruit bowl is placed centrally on the island, enhancing the aesthetic appeal without disrupting functionality. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.15m) ensures it does not interfere with seating or movement. The lighting fixture is installed on the ceiling directly above the island, providing focused illumination for cooking and dining. Its placement ensures even light distribution across the kitchen without obstructing movement or use of other kitchen elements.

The kitchen backsplash is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the aesthetic appeal of the kitchen while remaining functional and unobtrusive. The backsplash's dimensions (5.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) ensure it covers the wall without interfering with other kitchen elements.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of bar stool 3, which could not be positioned behind the island due to the presence of bar stool 1. To resolve this, bar stool 3 was repositioned to face the north wall, maintaining the circular seating arrangement without causing spatial conflicts. Additionally, the refrigerator was removed from the layout to prioritize the user's preference for a contemporary kitchen with a wooden island, metal bar stools, and a glass fruit bowl. This adjustment ensures the kitchen remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's vision.
