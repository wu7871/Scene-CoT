## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a dining area characterized by a cohesive and elegant aesthetic, with a focus on comfort and functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a teak dining table, orange fabric chairs, and a gold pendant light. The user desires a mid-century modern style, emphasizing a harmonious blend of materials and colors. The primary function of the room is to facilitate dining, with additional considerations for storage and decorative elements.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the dining table, serving as the focal point of the room. Surrounding this is the Dining Chair Area, where fabric chairs are strategically placed to optimize both functionality and aesthetics. Above the dining table, the Lighting Area is defined by the pendant light, enhancing the ambiance and providing necessary illumination. Lastly, the Storage Area is identified by the buffet, positioned against the south wall to complement the dining setup.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Table Area, a teak dining table with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters is recommended. The Dining Chair Area features three orange fabric chairs, each measuring 0.869 meters by 0.818 meters by 1.018 meters, providing comfortable seating around the table. The Lighting Area includes a gold pendant light with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, suspended from the ceiling to illuminate the dining area. Additionally, a buffet made of wood, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.8 meters, is recommended for the Storage Area to offer convenient storage and display options.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, a central element of the room, is placed in the middle, facing the north wall. This central placement ensures balance and symmetry, allowing chairs to be evenly distributed around it. The table's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, leaving ample space for movement and additional furniture. The fabric chairs are strategically placed to maintain balance and accessibility. Fabric_chair_1 is positioned behind the table, facing the north wall, while fabric_chair_2 is to the right of the table, facing the west wall. Fabric_chair_3 is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall, ensuring a balanced and aesthetically pleasing arrangement.

The pendant light is suspended directly above the dining table, providing optimal lighting and enhancing the room's aesthetic. Its placement on the ceiling ensures it does not interfere with floor space, aligning with the user's vision for a cohesive dining area. The buffet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, providing stability and easy access to stored items. This placement maintains balance and proportion, complementing the existing dining setup without obstructing movement or sightlines.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the dining table, which could not accommodate all intended objects. Specifically, the table was too small to support both coasters and the centerpiece. To resolve this, the coaster set was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the centerpiece, which enhances the visual appeal and aligns with the user's preference for a cohesive dining area. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing without overcrowding the dining table.
