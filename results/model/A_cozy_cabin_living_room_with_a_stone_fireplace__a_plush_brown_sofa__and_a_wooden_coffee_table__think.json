## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy cabin living room characterized by a stone fireplace, a plush brown sofa, and a wooden coffee table. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes warmth, comfort, and a rustic aesthetic, with specific areas designated for the fireplace, seating, and coffee table. The user desires a harmonious and inviting atmosphere, suggesting additional elements like lighting fixtures, wall art, and decorative cushions to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Fireplace Area, the Seating Area, and the Coffee Table Area. The Fireplace Area is central to the room's warmth and serves as a focal point. The Seating Area, featuring the sofa, provides comfort and relaxation. The Coffee Table Area supports functionality and complements the rustic theme. Additional elements such as lighting fixtures and wall art are considered to enhance the room's ambiance and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Fireplace Area, a rustic stone fireplace is recommended to enhance warmth and serve as a focal point. The Seating Area includes a plush brown sofa, complemented by decorative cushions for added comfort and style. A wooden coffee table is suggested for the Coffee Table Area, along with a rug to define the space. A rustic ceiling light is proposed to provide ambient lighting, while wall art adds visual interest and ties the rustic theme together.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stone fireplace, a key element for both warmth and aesthetic, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 1.5 meters in height. This placement ensures the fireplace is a focal point, enhancing the room's cozy cabin vibe and allowing heat distribution throughout the room. The rustic style and stone material align with the user's vision, and the central location on the south wall allows for optimal placement of other elements like the sofa and coffee table.

The wooden coffee table, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters, is centrally located in front of the fireplace. This placement ensures accessibility from the sofa and maintains a balanced layout. The table's natural wood color complements the rustic aesthetic, and its central alignment enhances the room's cozy atmosphere.

The plush brown sofa, with dimensions of 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning creates a comfortable seating arrangement, with the coffee table in front of it and the fireplace as a backdrop. The sofa's placement ensures balance and proportion, adhering to design principles and enhancing the room's cozy cabin feel.

Decorative cushion_1, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, is placed on the sofa. This addition enhances the seating area's comfort and aesthetic, aligning with the user's preference for a cozy cabin living room. The cushion's earth tones complement the rustic style, adding texture and visual interest.

The rustic ceiling light, with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, is centrally placed on the ceiling. This placement ensures even lighting across the room, enhancing the cozy cabin atmosphere without obstructing floor space or conflicting with other objects.

Wall art_1, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters, is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement avoids direct sunlight glare and complements the rustic decor, adding visual interest and cohesion to the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain the room's cozy cabin aesthetic. The arrangement ensures balance, functionality, and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles.
