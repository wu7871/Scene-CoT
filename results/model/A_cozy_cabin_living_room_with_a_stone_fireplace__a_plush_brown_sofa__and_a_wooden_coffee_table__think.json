## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy cabin living room characterized by a stone fireplace, a plush brown sofa, and a wooden coffee table. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes warmth, comfort, and rustic charm, with specific areas designated for the fireplace, seating, and a central open area. The user prefers a cohesive color palette and texture, with additional elements like cushions, a rug, and wall art to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Fireplace Area is the focal point, featuring the stone fireplace and mantle. The Seating Area includes the plush brown sofa and matching armchairs, creating a comfortable gathering spot. The Coffee Table Area is centrally located, serving as a functional and decorative element. Additional substructures include the Rug Area under the coffee table and the Wall Art Area on the east wall, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Fireplace Area, a rustic stone fireplace and a wooden mantle are recommended to create the focal point. The Seating Area features a plush brown sofa and two rustic armchairs, providing comfort and cohesion. A wooden coffee table is suggested for the Central Area, complementing the rustic theme. A cozy beige rug is recommended to define the seating area, while multicolor cushions add comfort and visual interest. Wall art in earth tones is proposed to enhance the rustic aesthetic without cluttering the space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stone fireplace, a key element for both warmth and aesthetic, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it becomes the focal point of the room, allowing the seating area to face it directly. The fireplace's rustic style and stone material align with the cozy cabin theme, and its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 1.5m) fit well against the wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts.

The wooden mantle is placed directly above the stone fireplace on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the aesthetic appeal by framing the fireplace and adding vertical interest. The mantle's dimensions (2.0m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allow it to fit above the fireplace without causing conflicts, maintaining balance and proportion.

The plush brown sofa is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This positioning allows it to be the centerpiece of the seating area, facing the stone fireplace. The sofa's dimensions (3.0m x 1.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, providing a direct line of sight to the fireplace and maintaining a cozy layout.

Armchair_1 is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.8m x 1.0m) allow it to fit adjacent to the sofa without spatial conflicts, enhancing the seating arrangement and maintaining a cohesive look. Armchair_2 is symmetrically placed to the left of the sofa, also facing the east wall, creating balance and symmetry in the seating area.

The wooden coffee table is centrally placed in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.5m) ensure it fits without overlapping other objects, maintaining balance and functionality in the room layout.

A cozy beige rug is placed under the coffee table, defining the seating area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit under the coffee table without overlapping other furniture, enhancing the room's cozy and rustic aesthetic.

Cushion_1 and Cushion_2 are placed on the sofa, providing comfort and aesthetic enhancement. Their dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensure they fit without causing spatial conflicts, adding color contrast and maintaining a cohesive seating area.

Wall_art_1 is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, adding aesthetic value and enhancing the overall rustic theme of the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed according to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a cohesive and functional layout for the cozy cabin living room.
