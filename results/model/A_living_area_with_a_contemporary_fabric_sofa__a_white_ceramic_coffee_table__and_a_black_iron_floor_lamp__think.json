## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary living area characterized by a fabric sofa, a ceramic coffee table, and a black iron floor lamp. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a modern aesthetic with a focus on comfort and functionality, emphasizing a central seating arrangement around the coffee table. Additional elements such as cushions, a rug, and wall art are suggested to enhance the room's aesthetic and comfort without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Sofa Area is designated for the fabric sofa, serving as the primary seating element. The Coffee Table Area is centrally located to facilitate interaction and support. The Lighting Area includes the placement of the floor lamp to provide ambient lighting. Additional areas include the Cushion Area for added comfort on the sofa, the Rug Area under the coffee table, and the Wall Art Area to enhance visual appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Area, a contemporary fabric sofa measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Coffee Table Area features a white ceramic coffee table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.45 meters. The Lighting Area includes a black iron floor lamp, providing essential lighting. To enhance comfort and aesthetics, two cushions (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters each) are recommended for the sofa. A grey rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested for the Rug Area, while multicolor wall art (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) is proposed for the Wall Art Area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The fabric sofa is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space and provides a focal point for the living area, allowing for easy conversation and movement. The sofa's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) fit well against the wall, ensuring stability and aesthetic balance. The placement process involved considering the room's dimensions and ensuring the sofa's orientation aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary setup.

The coffee table is centrally located in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures accessibility and complements the sofa's placement, creating a cohesive seating area. The coffee table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.45m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall. This placement provides optimal lighting for the seating area without obstructing views or movement. The lamp's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.8m) ensure it fits well beside the sofa, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Cushion_1 is placed on the sofa, providing comfort and enhancing the sofa's aesthetic. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space. Cushion_2 is symmetrically placed on the opposite side of the sofa, maintaining balance and comfort, and enhancing the aesthetic appeal.

The rug is placed under the coffee table, centrally located in front of the sofa. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) ensure it fits well without overlapping other furniture, adding warmth and comfort to the seating area.

Wall_art_1 is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures visibility from the seating area, enhancing the room's aesthetic without causing spatial conflicts. The wall art's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) ensure it complements the existing decor without overpowering it.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to avoid spatial conflicts, maintain aesthetic balance, and adhere to user preferences and design principles. The arrangement ensures a cohesive and functional living area with a contemporary style.
