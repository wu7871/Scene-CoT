## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary living area characterized by a fabric sofa, a white ceramic coffee table, and a black iron floor lamp. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional furniture and decor. The user prefers a minimalist aesthetic, emphasizing comfort and style while maintaining an open and inviting atmosphere. The primary focus is on creating a central seating area that balances functionality and aesthetics, with a preference for additional objects like cushions, a rug, and wall art to enhance the room's visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to fulfill the user's requirements. The Sofa Area is designated for the fabric sofa, serving as the main seating element. Adjacent to this is the Coffee Table Area, where the white ceramic coffee table is intended to provide functionality and style. The Lighting Area focuses on the placement of the black iron floor lamp to ensure adequate illumination. Additional areas include the Decor Area for wall art and the Rug Area under the coffee table to add texture and warmth. The seating arrangement aims to create a harmonious and balanced layout that supports the room's contemporary style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Area, a contemporary fabric sofa with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter is recommended to provide comfortable seating. The Coffee Table Area features a white ceramic coffee table measuring 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.45 meters, complementing the sofa and enhancing the room's aesthetic. A black iron floor lamp with dimensions of 0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters is suggested for the Lighting Area to offer adjustable lighting. The Decor Area includes a multicolor canvas wall art piece (1.5 meters by 0.1 meter by 1.0 meter) to add visual interest. A grey fabric rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) is recommended for the Rug Area to define the seating area and add warmth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts and aligning with the user's preference for a contemporary living area. This placement leaves ample space in front of the sofa for the coffee table and floor lamp, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The coffee table is centrally placed in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 1.2m x 0.8m x 0.45m, it fits well within the room's layout, providing a functional surface for items while complementing the sofa's contemporary style. This placement ensures easy access from the sofa and maintains a balanced layout.

The floor lamp is positioned to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.601m x 0.601m x 1.902m) allow it to fit without overlapping other objects, providing optimal lighting to the seating area while maintaining a contemporary and balanced look.

Wall art is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. With dimensions of 1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m, it enhances the room's aesthetic without conflicting with existing objects. This placement adds visual interest and complements the overall design of the room.

The rug is placed under the coffee table, in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) ensure it does not obstruct foot traffic or conflict with other furniture, adding warmth and texture to the seating area and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of multiple cushions on the sofa. The area of the sofa was insufficient to accommodate all four cushions simultaneously. To resolve this, cushions_3 and cushions_4 were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a contemporary fabric sofa with a white ceramic coffee table and a black iron floor lamp. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic balance.
