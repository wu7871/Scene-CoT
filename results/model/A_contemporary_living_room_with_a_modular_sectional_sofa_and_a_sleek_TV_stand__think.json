## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary living room characterized by a modular sectional sofa and a sleek TV stand, emphasizing a modern aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional elements such as armchairs, a coffee table, and decorative items. The user prefers a layout that balances comfort and style, with the sectional sofa against the south wall and the TV stand on the north wall, ensuring optimal viewing angles and maintaining an open and inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Sectional Sofa Area is designated along the south wall, serving as the primary seating zone. Adjacent to this is the TV Stand Area on the north wall, ensuring a direct line of sight for viewers seated on the sofa. The Open Middle Area is kept clear to facilitate easy movement and interaction between seating and entertainment zones. Additional areas include the Coffee Table Zone in front of the sectional sofa and the Decorative Area, which enhances the room's aesthetic with wall art and a rug.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sectional Sofa Area, a modern modular sectional sofa in grey fabric is recommended, providing both comfort and a cohesive look. The TV Stand Area features a sleek black TV stand, complementing the sectional sofa and enhancing the room's modern aesthetic. A contemporary coffee table, also in grey, is suggested to be placed centrally in front of the sectional sofa, offering functionality and style. Wall art in a minimalist style adds a splash of color and texture to the Decorative Area, while a beige rug under the coffee table grounds the space, tying the seating arrangement together.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional sofa, a central element of the living room, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space efficiency and provides a balanced view across the room, aligning with the user's preference for a contemporary style. The sofa's dimensions are 3.631 meters in length, 2.184 meters in width, and 0.926 meters in height, fitting well against the wall and leaving ample space for other furniture.

The TV stand is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall, directly opposite the sectional sofa. This placement ensures optimal viewing angles and complements the modern aesthetic of the living room. The TV stand measures 1.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, allowing it to fit comfortably against the wall without spatial conflicts.

The coffee table, measuring 1.464 meters in length, 0.887 meters in width, and 0.535 meters in height, is centrally placed in front of the sectional sofa. It is positioned under the TV stand when viewed from above, ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal. This placement maintains balance and proportion, adhering to design principles and user preferences.

Wall art, identified as wall_art_1, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Measuring 1.2 meters in length, 0.05 meters in width, and 0.8 meters in height, the art piece adds visual interest without obstructing any existing furniture. Its placement on the east wall ensures it is visible from the seating area, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the rug, initially intended to be under the coffee table, as the coffee table's position was adjusted. The rug could not be placed under the coffee table due to spatial constraints. To resolve this, the rug was repositioned to be in front of the sectional sofa, maintaining its function and aesthetic contribution to the room. Additionally, the TV stand's width was insufficient to accommodate the TV, leading to the decision to delete the TV based on its lower priority compared to the sectional sofa and TV stand. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's vision for a contemporary living room.
