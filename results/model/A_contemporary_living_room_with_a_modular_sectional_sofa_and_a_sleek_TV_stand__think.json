## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary living room characterized by a modular sectional sofa and a sleek TV stand. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a modern aesthetic with a focus on comfort and style, suggesting additional elements such as armchairs, a coffee table, decorative cushions, and wall art to enhance the room's functionality and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the placement of the sectional sofa and armchairs, creating a comfortable and inviting space. The Entertainment Area is centered around the TV stand, ensuring optimal viewing angles and accessibility. The Decorative Area includes wall art and a rug to add personality and warmth to the room. Lastly, the Lighting Area focuses on ambient lighting to enhance the room's atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern gray sectional sofa and two beige armchairs are recommended to provide comfort and maintain a cohesive look. The Entertainment Area features a black wooden TV stand and a contemporary TV to anchor the seating arrangement. In the Decorative Area, multicolor decorative cushions and abstract wall art are suggested to add vibrancy and personal touches. A contemporary silver rug is recommended to define the seating area and add warmth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional sofa, a central piece in the living room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures stability and allows for optimal viewing angles, making it a focal point in the room. The sofa's dimensions are 4.0 meters in length, 2.0 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height. Its placement against the north wall leaves ample space for other furniture, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

Armchair_1 is positioned to the left of the sectional sofa, facing the east wall. With dimensions of 0.9 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.0 meter, it complements the sectional sofa without overcrowding the space. This placement maintains balance and provides additional seating, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

Armchair_2 is placed to the right of the sectional sofa, facing the west wall. Measuring 0.9 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.0 meter, it creates symmetry with armchair_1, offering balanced seating arrangements. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts and enhances the room's contemporary style.

The TV stand is centrally located under the TV, placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter, it provides a stable base for the TV and complements the sectional sofa's placement. This setup ensures optimal viewing angles from all seating areas, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The TV, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.7 meters, is placed directly on the TV stand, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and optimal viewing angles, aligning with the user's vision for a sleek and modern living room.

Decorative_pillow_1 and decorative_pillow_2 are placed on the sectional sofa, enhancing its comfort and aesthetic appeal. Each pillow measures 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, fitting comfortably on the sofa without causing spatial conflicts. Their placement adds color contrast and maintains the room's contemporary style.

Wall_art_1 is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. With dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters, it serves as a decorative element, adding visual interest without cluttering the space. This placement ensures balance and complements the existing layout.

The rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.02 meters, is centrally placed under the sectional sofa and in front of armchairs 1 and 2. It defines the seating area and adds warmth and texture, enhancing the room's overall design and aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of armchair_3, initially intended to be behind the sectional sofa. The width of the sofa was insufficient to accommodate the armchair without causing spatial conflicts. To resolve this, armchair_3 was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a contemporary living room with a modular sectional sofa and a sleek TV stand. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic balance.

        5. reason: Final position calculation
            - calculation:
                - Final coordinates: x=3.1122, y=3.7158, z=1.1
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.1122, y: 3.7158, z: 1.1

For wall_art_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - wall_art_1 size: 1.0x0.05x0.7
            - Cluster size (on): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'east_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - x_min = 5.0 - 0.05/2 = 4.975
            - x_max = 5.0 - 0.05/2 = 4.975
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 0.7/2 = 0.35
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 0.7/2 = 2.65
        - conclusion: Possible position: (4.975, 4.975, 0.5, 4.5, 0.35, 2.65)
    3. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(4.975-4.975), y(0.5-4.5)
            - Final coordinates: x=4.975, y=2.7518, z=1.9844
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.975, y: 2.7518, z: 1.9844
    4. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    5. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=4.975, y=2.7518, z=1.9844
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.975, y: 2.7518, z: 1.9844
