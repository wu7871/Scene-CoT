## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an industrial-style loft characterized by raw materials and exposed structural elements. Key components include a leather sofa, a coffee table on wheels, and a metal shelf, all contributing to a minimalist yet robust aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired furniture arrangement. The user emphasizes the need for a cohesive industrial theme, efficient use of space, and ergonomic design, ensuring the room remains both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the leather sofa, which serves as the primary seating element. The Central Area is marked by the coffee table on wheels, facilitating easy repositioning and enhancing the room's functionality. The Storage Area is designated for the metal shelf, providing storage while maintaining the industrial aesthetic. Additional areas include the Open Movement Space, ensuring the room remains uncluttered, and the Ceiling Space, which is utilized for lighting to illuminate the entire loft.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a large leather sofa is recommended to anchor the room and align with the industrial theme. The Central Area features a coffee table on wheels, offering flexibility and accessibility. The Storage Area includes a metal shelf for storage purposes. To enhance the industrial theme, a floor lamp is suggested for ambient lighting, along with wall art for decorative purposes. A rug is proposed to define the seating area, adding warmth and texture to the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The leather sofa, a central piece in the industrial-style loft, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space usage and complements the loft's open design, allowing for a clear view across the room. The sofa's dimensions are 3.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 1.0 meter in height, fitting comfortably against the wall and leaving ample space for other furniture. This positioning ensures the sofa remains a focal point while adhering to the user's industrial theme.

The coffee table on wheels, measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.5 meters, is centrally located in front of the leather sofa. This placement allows for easy movement and interaction with the sofa, enhancing the room's usability. The table's industrial style complements the sofa, and its wheeled feature ensures it can be repositioned without obstruction, maintaining the room's industrial aesthetic.

The metal shelf, with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location provides stability and accessibility without blocking pathways or views, aligning with the user's preference for an industrial-style loft. The shelf's placement enhances the room's aesthetic and functionality, serving as a storage solution while complementing the overall design.

A floor lamp, measuring 1.8 meters in height, is placed to the right of the leather sofa, facing the north wall. This placement provides optimal lighting to the seating area without obstructing movement or view, enhancing the room's ambiance and maintaining the industrial theme.

Wall art, sized at 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters, is hung on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures the art is visible from the seating area, enhancing the room's aesthetic without causing spatial conflicts, adhering to the industrial theme.

Finally, a rug measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters is placed under the coffee table, in front of the leather sofa. This placement defines the seating area, adding warmth and texture to the room, and does not conflict with any other objects, completing the industrial-themed loft look.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain the room's industrial aesthetic, ensuring a cohesive and functional design.
