## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an industrial-style loft characterized by raw materials and exposed structural elements. Key elements include a leather sofa, a coffee table on wheels, and a metal shelf, which are essential for achieving the desired aesthetic and functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while maintaining an open and airy feel. The user prefers a loft-like atmosphere with exposed beams and brick walls, suggesting additional elements such as a rug, wall art, and a pendant light to enhance the industrial theme and ensure a cohesive design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to align with the user's industrial theme and functional needs. The Seating Area is defined by the placement of the leather sofa against the south wall, providing a comfortable space for relaxation. The Central Area features the coffee table on wheels, facilitating easy repositioning and enhancing the room's functionality. The Storage Area is marked by the metal shelf against the east wall, offering practical storage solutions. Additional elements like the rug under the coffee table and wall art on the west wall contribute to the overall aesthetic and cohesion of the loft.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a dark brown leather sofa measuring 3.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter is recommended, providing comfort and a cohesive industrial look. The Central Area features a metal coffee table on wheels, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters, which allows for flexible positioning. The Storage Area includes a metal shelf measuring 1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters, offering robust storage options. A black metal pendant light (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter) is suggested for the ceiling to provide ambient lighting. Wall art (1.0 meter by 0.1 meter by 1.0 meter) is recommended for the west wall to enhance the aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The leather sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a strong focal point and allow for optimal space usage in the industrial loft setting. Its dimensions (3.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) fit well along the wall, providing a sense of enclosure and support, which is typical of industrial-style furniture. This placement ensures the sofa remains accessible and does not obstruct other elements, maintaining an open and airy feel.

The coffee table on wheels is centrally located in front of the leather sofa, facing the north wall. This placement ensures accessibility and complements the industrial style with its metal material. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably in the space, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic without causing clutter.

The metal shelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning ensures it is visible yet unobtrusive, providing storage without disrupting the room's flow. The shelf's dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 2.0m) make it suitable for wall placement, adhering to industrial design principles and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The pendant light is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even illumination throughout the room. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to hang freely without interference from other objects. This placement aligns with the industrial style and provides necessary lighting, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Wall art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.1m x 1.0m) ensure it does not overwhelm the space, adding visual interest without causing clutter. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic balance and complements the industrial theme.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The rug, side table, floor lamp, and plant were identified as conflicting with the existing leather sofa and coffee table. To resolve these conflicts, the rug, side table, floor lamp, and plant were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for an industrial-style loft with a leather sofa, coffee table on wheels, and metal shelf. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic integrity, ensuring a cohesive and uncluttered design.
