## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a comfortable bedroom that incorporates specific furniture pieces such as a double bed with fabric upholstery, two wooden nightstands, and a classic wardrobe. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional elements like a rug, a lamp, and artwork to enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The user emphasizes a classic style, with a preference for cohesive and harmonious furnishings that contribute to a warm and inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area is centered around the double bed, which is placed against the north wall to allow easy movement and maximize space usage. Adjacent to the bed are the Nightstand Areas, where nightstands are positioned to provide convenient storage and lighting. The Wardrobe Area is located against the east wall, ensuring stability and accessibility for clothing storage. Additional areas include a Rug Area under the bed for comfort and warmth, and a Wall Art Area on the south wall for decorative enhancement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a classic double bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 1.5 meters is recommended, complemented by a wool rug measuring 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters. The Nightstand Areas feature classic wooden nightstands, each 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters, paired with brass lamps for lighting. The Wardrobe Area includes a classic wooden wardrobe measuring 2.0 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.5 meters. A canvas wall art piece, 1.0 meter by 0.1 meter by 0.8 meter, is suggested for the Wall Art Area to add visual interest.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed, a central element of the room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures optimal space utilization and easy movement within the room, aligning with the user's preference for a classic style. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 1.5m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion while leaving space for other furniture. The nightstand_1 is placed to the right of the bed, facing the north wall, ensuring adjacency and functionality. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bed, providing convenient storage and lighting. The lamp_1 is placed on nightstand_1, facing the north wall, enhancing the nightstand's functionality and maintaining aesthetic consistency. The nightstand_2 is symmetrically placed to the left of the bed, facing the north wall, ensuring even distribution and accessibility. The wardrobe is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring stability and accessibility without obstructing other furniture. The rug is centrally placed under the bed, extending towards the nightstands, providing comfort and warmth while enhancing the room's aesthetic. Finally, the wall_art_1 is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, adding visual interest without conflicting with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of multiple objects on nightstand_1, specifically lamp_1, vase_1, and book_1. The area on nightstand_1 was insufficient to accommodate all three objects simultaneously. To resolve this, vase_1 and book_1 were removed, prioritizing the lamp for its dual function of providing light and maintaining aesthetic harmony. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a comfortable bedroom with essential elements like the bed, nightstands, and wardrobe.
