## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic makeup room designed to optimize both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Essential elements include a vanity mirror, a dressing table, and a small stool, all contributing to a luxurious ambiance. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a chic style, with specific areas designated for the dressing table and stool, and an open area for the vanity mirror. Additional recommendations include a wall-mounted shelf for organizing makeup items, a rug under the stool for comfort, and decorative elements like a vase or artwork to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to fulfill the user's requirements. The Dressing Table Area is designated for the dressing table and stool, focusing on elegance and functionality. The Vanity Mirror Area is centrally located, ensuring optimal lighting and reflection. An Open Area is maintained around the vanity mirror to allow free movement and enhance the room's spacious feel. Additional areas include a Wall-Mounted Shelf Area for organizing makeup, and a Central Rug Area under the stool for added comfort.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dressing Table Area, a chic dressing table (1.5m x 0.8m x 1.2m) and a matching stool (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) are recommended to provide a cohesive and functional makeup application area. A wall-mounted shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 1.5m) is suggested for organizing makeup items. A chic velvet rug (1.2m x 1.2m x 0.02m) is recommended for the Central Rug Area to add comfort and texture. Decorative elements like a chic gold vase (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) and artwork (1.0m x 0.1m x 1.5m) are proposed to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dressing table is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to maximize space efficiency and maintain a chic look. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 1.2m) fit well against the wall, allowing ample space for the stool and vanity mirror. The placement ensures easy access and usage, aligning with the user's chic style preference. The stool is positioned directly in front of the dressing table, facing the west wall, ensuring functionality and aesthetic coherence. Its placement maintains balance and proportion, enhancing the room's chic style. The wall-mounted shelf is installed above the dressing table on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy access to makeup items while using the dressing table, optimizing functionality and maintaining the room's chic aesthetic. The rug is placed under the stool, in the middle of the room, to provide comfort and define the dressing area. Its central placement under the stool enhances the room's aesthetic and functional layout. The vase is placed on the dressing table, facing the west wall, adding a decorative touch that complements the chic style without obstructing functionality. The artwork is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing a focal point that enhances the room's chic aesthetic without conflicting with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of multiple objects on the dressing table, specifically the vase, artwork, and jewelry stand. The length of the dressing table was insufficient to accommodate all these objects simultaneously. To resolve this, the jewelry stand was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the vase and artwork, which contribute more significantly to the room's chic aesthetic and functionality.
