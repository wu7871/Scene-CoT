## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic makeup room featuring a vanity mirror, a dressing table, and a small stool. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements. The user's preferences emphasize a chic aesthetic, suggesting luxurious materials and a cohesive color scheme. Functionally, the room requires a vanity mirror for makeup application, a dressing table for organizing cosmetics, and a stool for seating. Additional elements such as a rug, ambient lighting, and wall art are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Vanity Mirror Area is designated for the central vanity mirror, ensuring it is the focal point of the room. Adjacent to this is the Dressing Table Area, which includes the dressing table and stool, forming a functional makeup application zone. The Lighting Area focuses on ambient lighting to enhance the room's ambiance. Lastly, the Decorative Area is intended for wall art, adding visual interest and personality to the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Vanity Mirror Area, a chic-style vanity mirror with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended. The Dressing Table Area features a chic dressing table (1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters) and a matching stool (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters) to facilitate makeup application. The Lighting Area includes a chic floor lamp (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.8 meters) to provide ambient lighting. Wall art, although initially considered, was removed due to spatial constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The vanity mirror is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it is the focal point of the room, providing optimal lighting and a clear view for makeup application. The mirror's chic style complements the overall aesthetic, and its dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall without spatial conflicts.

The dressing table is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures it is adjacent to the vanity mirror, creating a cohesive makeup application area. The table's dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.9m) allow it to fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The stool is placed in front of the dressing table, facing the east wall. This placement ensures easy access for seating while using the dressing table. The stool's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing other objects, enhancing the room's functionality and chic aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the rug under the dressing table and stool, as the width of the stool was too small to accommodate the rug. To resolve this, the rug was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a chic makeup room with a vanity mirror, dressing table, and stool. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic without compromising the overall design.
