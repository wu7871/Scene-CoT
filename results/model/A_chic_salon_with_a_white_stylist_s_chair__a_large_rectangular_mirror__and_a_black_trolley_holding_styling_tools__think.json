## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic salon characterized by a white stylist's chair, a large rectangular mirror, and a black trolley holding styling tools. The salon's aesthetic is modern and elegant, with a focus on functionality and style. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired layout. The user emphasizes a chic ambiance, suggesting additional elements like ambient lighting and decorative items to enhance the salon's sophistication.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The salon is divided into several functional substructures: the Styling Station, which includes the stylist's chair, mirror, and trolley; the Lighting Area, focusing on ambient lighting to enhance the chic ambiance; and the Decorative Area, which incorporates elements like wall art to complete the salon's aesthetic. Each substructure serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall design and functionality of the salon.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Styling Station, a modern white stylist's chair, a large rectangular mirror, and a black trolley are recommended to hold styling tools. The Lighting Area features a modern ambient light fixture to ensure adequate illumination throughout the salon. In the Decorative Area, contemporary wall art is suggested to add visual interest and complement the salon's chic style. Additional recommendations include a rug under the stylist's chair to define the space and a plant for a touch of greenery and freshness.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stylist's chair, a central element of the salon, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal, allowing the stylist to have a full view of the room while working. The chair's dimensions are 0.673 meters in length, 0.691 meters in width, and 1.037 meters in height, fitting comfortably against the wall without obstructing movement. The mirror, measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 2.0 meters, is centrally placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning provides a clear reflection area for the stylist and client, enhancing the salon's functionality and aesthetic balance.

The trolley, with dimensions of 0.9 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.8 meters, is positioned to the right of the stylist's chair, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to styling tools while maintaining the room's chic and functional layout. The ambient light, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters, is centrally located on the ceiling, providing even illumination across the room. Wall art, with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, adding a decorative element that complements the salon's modern style.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space on the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects, including the stylist's chair, mirror, trolley, and plant. To resolve this, the plant was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the stylist's chair, mirror, and trolley, which are essential for the salon's functionality and user preference. This adjustment ensures the room remains chic and functional without overcrowding.
