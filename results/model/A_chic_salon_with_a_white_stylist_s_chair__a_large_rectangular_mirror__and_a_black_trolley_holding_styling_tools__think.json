## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic salon characterized by a minimalist yet luxurious ambiance, with a focus on functionality and aesthetic appeal. Essential elements include a white stylist's chair, a large rectangular mirror, and a black trolley for styling tools. The salon should feature a central open space to facilitate client movement and interaction, complemented by ambient lighting to enhance the modern aesthetic. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired layout.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The salon is divided into several key areas to optimize both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The Stylist's Chair Area is centrally located, serving as the focal point for client interaction. The Mirror Area is positioned opposite the chair to allow for styling and client viewing. The Trolley Area is adjacent to the chair for tool accessibility. An Open Central Space is maintained for easy client movement and interaction. Additionally, Ambient Lighting is strategically placed to illuminate the space effectively.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Stylist's Chair Area, a modern white chair with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended. The Mirror Area features a large rectangular mirror measuring 2.0 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.8 meters. A modern black trolley, 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.5 meters, is suggested for the Trolley Area. Ambient lighting, including a ceiling light and floor lamp, is recommended to enhance the salon's aesthetic and provide adequate illumination.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stylist's chair, a central element of the salon, is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures optimal visibility and accessibility, allowing the stylist to face the entrance while working. The chair's dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.2m) fit well within the room, ensuring it does not obstruct pathways or future placements of mirrors or trolleys. The large mirror is placed on the north wall, directly facing the stylist's chair. This placement ensures that clients seated in the chair can easily view themselves while being styled. The mirror's dimensions (2.0m x 0.1m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably without causing spatial conflicts. The trolley is placed to the right of the stylist's chair, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access for the stylist without obstructing the mirror or creating spatial conflicts. The trolley's dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.5m) make it suitable for this location. The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even distribution of light throughout the room. Its modern style complements the overall aesthetic of the salon. The floor lamp is placed to the left of the stylist's chair, facing the north wall. This placement provides additional lighting towards the mirror and styling area without obstructing the view or access to other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the wall clock, which could not be positioned left of the mirror due to the presence of the ceiling light. To resolve this, the wall clock was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the other elements specified by the user. This decision maintained the chic salon aesthetic while ensuring the room's functionality and user preferences were respected.
