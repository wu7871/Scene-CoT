## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a farmhouse kitchen characterized by rustic charm and functionality. Key elements include a ceramic double sink, a wooden kitchen island, and a hanging pot rack. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a cohesive farmhouse aesthetic while ensuring the kitchen is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Additional recommendations include a farmhouse-style rug, pendant lighting for the pot rack, and decorative elements like wall art or a kitchen garden to enhance the rustic theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Sink Area is designated for the ceramic double sink, serving as the focal point of the kitchen. The Kitchen Island Area is centrally located, providing space for meal preparation and gathering. The Hanging Pot Rack Area is positioned above the kitchen island for easy access to pots and pans. Additional areas include the Lighting Area for pendant lighting and the Decorative Area for enhancing the farmhouse theme with wall art and a rug.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a farmhouse-style ceramic double sink with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Kitchen Island Area features a rustic wooden kitchen island measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters. The Hanging Pot Rack Area includes a wrought iron pot rack with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. A rustic farmhouse rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) is suggested for the Decorative Area. Pendant lighting is recommended for the Lighting Area to complement the hanging pot rack. Finally, wall art and a kitchen garden are proposed to enhance the farmhouse aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The ceramic double sink is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it serves as a focal point upon entering the kitchen, adhering to the farmhouse style and providing functional benefits such as plumbing access. The sink's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring balance and proportion in the room.

The kitchen island is centrally located in the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow it to serve as a central gathering point, facilitating meal preparation and social interaction. This placement avoids blocking access to the sink and provides balance and functionality within the kitchen layout.

The hanging pot rack is installed above the kitchen island, facing downward to facilitate easy access to pots and pans. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not interfere with other kitchen elements, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The farmhouse rug is placed under the kitchen island, centered in the room. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to anchor the kitchen island and provide a cohesive look, enhancing the rustic farmhouse theme without obstructing functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of multiple objects, specifically the hanging pot rack, kitchen island, and ceramic double sink. The width of the kitchen island was insufficient to accommodate the hanging pot rack to its left, leading to a spatial conflict. To resolve this, the hanging pot rack and kitchen island were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a farmhouse kitchen with a ceramic double sink. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a cohesive and balanced design.

## 6. Object Placement
For ceramic_double_sink_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with south_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of ceramic_double_sink_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of south_wall: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - ceramic_double_sink_1 size: 1.2 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 1.2) = 1.2
        - conclusion: hanging_pot_rack_1 cluster size (on): 1.2
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - ceramic_double_sink_1 size: length=1.2, width=0.8, height=0.9
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.2/2 = 0.6
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.2/2 = 4.4
            - y_min = y_max = 0.4
            - z_min = z_max = 0.45
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.6, 4.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.45, 0.45)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.6-4.4), y(0.4-0.4)
            - Final coordinates: x=2.9653, y=0.4, z=0.45
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.9653, y: 0.4, z: 0.45
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects present for collision check
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=2.9653, y=0.4, z=0.45
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.9653, y: 0.4, z: 0.45
