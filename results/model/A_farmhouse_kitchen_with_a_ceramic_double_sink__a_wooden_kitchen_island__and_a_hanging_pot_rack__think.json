        - calculation:
            - lighting_fixture_1 has no child, so no rotation difference calculation needed.
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation required.
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'ceiling' relation
        - calculation:
            - lighting_fixture_1 size: length=0.601, width=0.601, height=1.202
            - Cluster size: {'left of': 0.0, 'right of': 0.0, 'behind': 0.0, 'in front': 0.0}

For wall_art_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with no child
        - calculation:
            - wall_art_1 has no child, so no rotation difference calculation needed.
