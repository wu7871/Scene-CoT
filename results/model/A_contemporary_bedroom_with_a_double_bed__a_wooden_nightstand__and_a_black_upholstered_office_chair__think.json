## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary bedroom characterized by a minimalist aesthetic, featuring a double bed, a wooden nightstand, and a black upholstered office chair. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a modern and calming atmosphere, with specific areas designated for rest, reading, and working. The primary focus is on creating a cohesive and functional layout that avoids clutter while ensuring ergonomic spacing between furniture pieces.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Bed Area, Nightstand Area, and Office Chair Area. The Bed Area is positioned against the north wall, serving as the central zone for rest and sleep. The Nightstand Area is adjacent to the bed, providing a convenient location for personal items and lighting. The Office Chair Area is located near the south wall, facilitating work activities and maintaining a balanced room layout. Additional elements such as a rug, wall art, and a ceiling light are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bed Area, a contemporary double bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended, accompanied by a minimalist wool rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) to add comfort and texture. The Nightstand Area features a wooden nightstand (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters) and a silver lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) to provide functionality and style. In the Office Chair Area, a black upholstered office chair (1.0 meter by 0.8 meters by 1.2 meters) is suggested, along with a grey metal desk (1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters) to create a cohesive workspace. A multicolor canvas wall art (1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters) is recommended for aesthetic enhancement, while a gold ceiling light (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters) provides ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed, a central element of the room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures stability and maximizes space usage, allowing easy access from both sides and leaving ample room for other furniture. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. The nightstand is positioned to the right of the bed, facing the south wall, ensuring it is adjacent to the bed and easily accessible. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bed, providing functional support for holding items while in bed. The lamp is placed on the nightstand, facing the south wall, ensuring it provides effective lighting for the bed area without causing spatial conflicts. The rug is centrally placed under the bed, extending slightly beyond it towards the nightstand. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) ensure it fits comfortably under the bed and around it, enhancing the aesthetic and comfort of the room. The wall art is centered on the east wall, facing the west wall, providing a focal point visible from the bed without causing spatial conflicts. The office chair is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, ensuring it does not block access to other furniture and maintains a contemporary aesthetic. The desk is placed behind the office chair, facing the north wall, ensuring it is adjacent and functional as a workspace. The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downwards, providing even illumination across the room without obstructing any existing objects.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional layout. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, adhering to design principles and enhancing the room's contemporary aesthetic.
