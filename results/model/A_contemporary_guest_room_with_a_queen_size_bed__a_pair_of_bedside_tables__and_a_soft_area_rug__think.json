## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary guest room characterized by a minimalist aesthetic, featuring a queen-size bed, a pair of bedside tables, and a soft area rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while ensuring the room remains open and uncluttered. The primary focus is on creating a serene and calming environment suitable for guests, with a preference for modern design elements and a cohesive color palette.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Bed Area, which serves as the focal point for rest and sleep; the Bedside Areas, designed to offer convenience and accessibility with bedside tables and lamps; and the Central Area, where the area rug is intended to add warmth and comfort. Each substructure is carefully planned to maintain the room's minimalist and contemporary style while fulfilling functional and aesthetic goals.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bed Area, a contemporary queen-size bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.6 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Bedside Areas feature two modern bedside tables, each measuring 0.557 meters by 0.413 meters by 0.866 meters, complemented by two minimalist bedside lamps, each 0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.702 meters, to provide lighting and ambiance. The Central Area includes a soft grey area rug measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, adding comfort and visual interest. A modern wall-mounted art piece, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.0 meter, is suggested to enhance the aesthetic without cluttering the space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The queen-size bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as the room's focal point. This placement ensures stability and maximizes floor space, allowing easy access around the bed and aligning with the user's vision for a contemporary guest room. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.6m x 0.5m) fit well against the wall, providing balance and proportion while leaving ample space for other elements.

The first bedside table is positioned to the right of the bed, facing the west wall, with the lamp placed on it. This arrangement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room. The bedside table's dimensions (0.557m x 0.413m x 0.866m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bed, providing a convenient spot for items like a lamp or a book. The lamp, measuring 0.601m x 0.601m x 1.702m, complements the bedside table, enhancing the room's lighting and aesthetic.

The second bedside table is symmetrically placed to the left of the bed, facing the east wall, with another lamp on it. This placement ensures balance and accessibility, with both sides of the bed having identical setups. The table's dimensions (0.557m x 0.413m x 0.866m) and the lamp's size (0.601m x 0.601m x 1.702m) allow them to fit comfortably without obstructing movement or sightlines.

The area rug is centrally placed under the bed, extending towards the middle of the room. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to fit under the bed and provide a cohesive look without overwhelming the space. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic and provides a comfortable walking surface, tying together the elements in the room.

The art piece is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring it is visible from the bed and does not conflict with any existing furniture. The art piece's dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) make it suitable for wall placement, adding visual interest without occupying floor space.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically placed to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain the room's contemporary and minimalist aesthetic. The arrangement ensures functionality and aesthetic harmony, with each element contributing to the overall design without overcrowding the space.
