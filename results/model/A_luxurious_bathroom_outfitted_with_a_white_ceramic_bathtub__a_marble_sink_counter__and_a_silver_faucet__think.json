## 4. Scene Graph
The bathtub, a central element of the luxurious bathroom, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and ensures stability, making it the focal point of the room. The bathtub's dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts and adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The sink counter is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement complements the bathtub without causing spatial conflicts, maintaining balance and functionality. The sink counter's dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 1.0m) ensure it does not block pathways or interfere with the bathtub's use, enhancing the room's luxurious aesthetic.

The faucet is centrally placed on the sink counter, facing the west wall. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic coherence, with dimensions (0.152m x 0.13m x 0.214m) that fit well within the sink counter's space, avoiding any spatial conflicts.

The shower enclosure is placed in the northeast corner, facing the southwest wall. This positioning maintains a luxurious and functional bathroom layout, with dimensions (1.5m x 1.5m x 2.2m) that ensure no overlap with existing objects, enhancing the room's luxurious feel.

The towel rack is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures accessibility from the bathtub and sink counter, with dimensions (0.621m x 0.281m x 1.94m) that allow it to fit without conflict, enhancing the room's luxurious aesthetic.

The mirror is placed above the sink counter on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic coherence, with dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) that complement the existing marble sink counter, avoiding spatial conflicts.

The ambient light is placed on the ceiling, centrally located to provide even illumination throughout the room. This placement enhances the luxurious ambiance without obstructing any existing objects, with dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.5m) that ensure it serves its purpose effectively.
