## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room characterized by a sophisticated and functional atmosphere. Key elements include a mahogany desk, a leather reclining chair, and a set of bookcases, all contributing to a classic aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for a workspace that supports reading and writing, storage for books, and comfortable seating. Additional elements such as a rug, lighting fixtures, and decorative items are suggested to enhance the room's classic ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Mahogany Desk Area is designated for the primary workspace, featuring the desk and chair. Adjacent to this is the Bookcase Area, which provides storage for books. The Lighting Area focuses on ensuring adequate illumination for reading and writing. Lastly, the Decorative Area is intended to enhance the room's classic aesthetic with items like a rug and wall art.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Mahogany Desk Area, a classic mahogany desk and a leather reclining chair are recommended to create a cohesive and functional workspace. The Bookcase Area features a classic wooden bookcase for storing books. To enhance lighting, a crystal chandelier is suggested for the Ceiling Area. Additionally, a wool rug and classic-style wall art are recommended to add warmth and visual interest to the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The mahogany desk, a central piece in the classic study, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures stability and allows for optimal lighting from a potential window on the south wall, enhancing the workspace. The desk's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.9 meters in height. The leather reclining chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the north wall, ensuring ergonomic use and easy access to the desk. The chair's dimensions are 1.0 meter in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 1.2 meters in height.

The bookcase is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to maximize space efficiency and maintain balance within the room. Its dimensions are 1.5 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 2.5 meters in height. The rug is centrally placed under the desk and chair, defining the workspace area. It measures 3.0 meters in length, 2.0 meters in width, and 0.02 meters in height. The chandelier is suspended from the ceiling in the middle of the room, providing even lighting across all areas. Its dimensions are 0.7 meters in length and width, and 1.0 meter in height.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the wall clock, which could not be positioned left of the bookcase due to the presence of the mahogany desk. Additionally, the floor lamp was unable to be placed right of the desk due to the chair's position. To resolve these conflicts, the wall clock and floor lamp were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a classic study with essential furniture like the mahogany desk, leather chair, and bookcase. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and classic aesthetic.
