## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room characterized by a sophisticated and functional atmosphere. Key elements include a mahogany desk, a leather reclining chair, and a set of bookcases, all contributing to a classic aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while ensuring easy movement and adequate lighting. The user emphasizes the need for a classic ambiance, efficient lighting, and comfortable seating, with additional suggestions for a rug, wall sconces, and decorative items to enhance the room's classic and functional theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Mahogany Desk Area serves as the central workspace, featuring the desk and chair for writing and reading. The Bookcase Area is designated for storing books, maintaining organization and accessibility. The Lighting Area focuses on providing ambient and task lighting through strategically placed fixtures. Additional areas include a Rug Area to define the space and add warmth, and Decorative Areas for wall sconces and a clock to enhance the classic aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Mahogany Desk Area, a classic mahogany desk and a leather reclining chair are recommended to create a cohesive and functional workspace. The Bookcase Area features classic-style bookcases made of dark wood to complement the desk and chair. To enhance the lighting, a brass floor lamp is suggested for additional illumination. A wool rug is recommended for the Rug Area to add texture and warmth. Wall sconces and a classic clock are proposed for Decorative Areas to complete the aesthetic and functional goals of the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The mahogany desk, a central piece in the classic study, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures it remains the focal point of the room, providing stability and allowing for optimal lighting and ventilation. The desk's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 1.0 meter in height, fitting well within the room's dimensions and leaving ample space for additional furniture. The leather reclining chair, initially intended to be behind the desk, was removed due to spatial constraints, prioritizing the desk's central role.

Bookcase_1, a classic dark wood bookcase, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement complements the mahogany desk and maintains a balanced layout, allowing easy access to books without obstructing the room's flow. The bookcase's dimensions are 2.5 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 2.5 meters in height, ensuring it stands prominently without overwhelming the space.

The floor lamp, initially positioned to provide additional lighting near the desk, was removed due to spatial conflicts. Its intended placement was to the right of the desk, facing the north wall, but it was deleted to maintain the room's classic study setup without overcrowding.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space available for the reclining chair and floor lamp. The reclining chair could not be placed behind the desk without overlapping with the bookcase, leading to its deletion as it was deemed less critical than the desk. Similarly, the floor lamp conflicted with the chair's position and was also deleted to preserve the room's classic study setup. These adjustments ensured the room remained functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles.
