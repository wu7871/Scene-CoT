## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a dining area characterized by a wooden dining table, a set of chairs, and a contemporary chandelier. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired furniture arrangement. The primary focus is on creating a central dining area that emphasizes both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Additional elements such as a sideboard or buffet, a rug, and wall art are considered to enhance the room's ambiance and provide balance and proportion.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to fulfill the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the dining table and chairs, forming the core of the dining setup. Above the dining table, the ceiling is reserved for the chandelier, providing lighting and a focal point. Additionally, the east wall is allocated for the sideboard, offering storage and display options. The rug under the dining table grounds the space, while wall art on the west wall adds visual interest and complements the overall decor.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central dining area, a classic wooden dining table with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four classic wooden chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. A contemporary crystal chandelier, measuring 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter, is suggested for the ceiling to provide lighting and serve as a focal point. A classic wooden sideboard, 2.0 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.5 meters, is proposed for the east wall to offer storage. A bohemian-style wool rug, 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is recommended under the dining table to add warmth and texture. Finally, contemporary canvas wall art, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter, is suggested for the west wall to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to allow for optimal circulation and accessibility from all sides. This central placement ensures balance and symmetry, making the dining table a focal point in the room. The table's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) fit well within the room's size, leaving ample space for chairs and other decorative elements.

Chair_1 is positioned behind the dining table, facing the north wall, ensuring it is adjacent to the table and does not obstruct movement. This placement maintains balance and proportion, enhancing the room's aesthetic and functional dining setup. Chair_2 is placed in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, directly opposite chair_1. This symmetrical arrangement allows diners to sit comfortably facing the table, adhering to design principles and user preferences.

Chair_3 is positioned to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall, ensuring it is adjacent to the table and complements the existing setup. Chair_4 is placed to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall, completing the symmetrical arrangement around the table. Both chairs face the dining table, ensuring functionality and aesthetic balance.

The chandelier is centrally placed above the dining table, suspended from the ceiling, to provide even lighting across the table. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) ensure it fits well above the table without touching it, maintaining balance and proportion while serving its lighting function.

The sideboard is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement maximizes space usage and provides easy access for storage without disrupting the dining setup. The sideboard's dimensions (2.0m x 0.6m x 1.5m) fit well along the wall, adding stability and functionality.

The rug is centrally placed under the dining table, covering the floor space beneath it. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to fit under the dining table and extend slightly beyond, defining the dining area and adding warmth and texture to the room.

Wall art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures it does not interfere with any existing furniture and complements the room's decor. The wall art's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) ensure it fits well on the wall, adding visual interest and balance to the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional dining area. The arrangement adheres to design principles, maintaining balance, proportion, and functionality throughout the room.

For wall_art_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with west_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of wall_art_1: 90.0°
            - Rotation of west_wall: 90.0°
            - Rotation difference: |90.0 - 90.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using width dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'west_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - west_wall size: 5.0 (length)
            - Cluster size (west_wall): max(0.0, 0.0) = 0.0
        - conclusion: Size constraint (west_wall): 0.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - wall_art_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.05, height=1.0
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.05/2 = 0.025
            - x_max = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.05/2 = 0.025
            - y_min = 2.5 + -1 * 5.0/2 + 1 * 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 2.5 + 1 * 5.0/2 + -1 * 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 2.5
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.025, 0.025, 0.5, 4.5, 0.5, 2.5)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:

        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.025, y: 3.9859, z: 1.6531
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
