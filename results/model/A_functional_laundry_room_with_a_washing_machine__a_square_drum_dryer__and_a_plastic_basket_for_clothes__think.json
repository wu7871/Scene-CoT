## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional laundry room that includes essential components such as a washing machine, a square drum dryer, and a plastic basket for clothes. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on organizing these elements efficiently while ensuring easy access and movement. Additional elements like a detergent dispenser, ironing board, folding table, and storage cabinet are suggested to enhance the room's functionality. The aesthetic should remain minimalistic, with a cohesive color scheme and material selection to maintain a clean and organized look.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to optimize functionality. The Laundry Appliance Zone includes the washing machine and dryer, positioned together for convenience. The Sorting and Stain Treatment Area features the detergent dispenser and plastic basket, facilitating easy access during the laundry process. The Ironing and Folding Area is designated for the ironing board and folding table, providing surfaces for ironing and folding clothes. Lastly, the Storage Area includes the storage cabinet, offering additional storage solutions for detergents and cleaning supplies.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Laundry Appliance Zone, a modern-style washing machine and dryer are recommended, both made of stainless steel for durability and efficiency. The Detergent Dispenser is a compact plastic accessory placed adjacent to the washing machine. In the Ironing and Folding Area, a classic-style ironing board and folding table are suggested to provide versatile functionality. The Storage Area features a modern white wooden storage cabinet for organizing cleaning supplies. A minimalist laundry basket is recommended for the Sorting and Stain Treatment Area, ensuring easy access and organization.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine, a central element of the laundry room, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning ensures stability and ease of use, with ample space for maneuvering clothes baskets or dryers. The washing machine's dimensions are 0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters, fitting comfortably against the wall and leaving room for other appliances. The dryer, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed to the right of the washing machine, also against the east wall and facing the west wall. This arrangement maintains a functional workflow and aesthetic balance, with both appliances being of similar size and style.

The detergent dispenser, a small plastic accessory, is placed directly above the washing machine on the east wall, facing the west wall. This ensures it is easily accessible for use during washing cycles, enhancing the room's functionality. The laundry basket, made of plastic, is placed in front of the washing machine in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This placement allows for easy sorting and feeding of clothes into the washing machine, maintaining a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose with the ironing board and folding table. The ironing board could not be left of the dryer due to the washing machine's position, and the folding table could not be left of the ironing board for the same reason. To resolve these conflicts, the ironing board and folding table were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a functional laundry room with essential appliances. This decision maintained the room's functionality and adhered to the user's requirements.
