## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional laundry room that includes a washing machine, a square drum dryer, and a plastic basket for clothes. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on organizing the space efficiently while ensuring ease of use and maintenance. The user prefers a modern aesthetic, with additional elements such as a folding ironing board, a clothes rack, a laundry detergent holder, and lighting fixtures to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Washing Machine Area is designated for the washing machine and its accessories, ensuring stability and accessibility. Adjacent to this is the Drying Area, which accommodates the drum dryer and a clothes rack for air-drying. The Central Sorting Area is intended for the plastic basket and a laundry detergent holder, facilitating easy sorting and dispensing of detergent. Additionally, a Folding Ironing Board Area is included to support ironing tasks, enhancing the room's functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Washing Machine Area, a modern-style washing machine with dimensions of 0.7 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter is recommended, along with a matching plastic basket (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters) for sorting clothes. The Drying Area features a modern drum dryer (1.0 meter by 1.0 meter by 1.5 meters) and a clothes rack (1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.8 meters) for additional drying options. A modern lighting fixture (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) is suggested for the ceiling to ensure adequate illumination. The Central Sorting Area includes a laundry detergent holder (0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.2 meters) to keep supplies organized.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning ensures optimal functionality and user convenience, allowing easy access to plumbing and electrical connections. The washing machine's dimensions (0.7m x 0.8m x 1.0m) fit well against the wall, leaving ample space for other appliances. The plastic basket is positioned to the right of the washing machine, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy access after washing clothes, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The drum dryer is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This location ensures it is adjacent to the washing machine, creating a functional workflow and utilizing space efficiently. The dryer's dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, enhancing the room's functionality without overcrowding. The lighting fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even distribution of light throughout the room. Its small size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensures it does not interfere with floor space or other objects.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the east wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. Specifically, the ironing board, detergent holder, and clothes rack were identified as conflicting with the washing machine and plastic basket. To resolve this, the ironing board, detergent holder, and clothes rack were removed, prioritizing the essential elements of the laundry room—washing machine, drum dryer, and plastic basket—to maintain functionality and user preference.
