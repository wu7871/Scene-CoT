The chaise lounge's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.9 meters in height. Its luxurious style and deep blue color complement the room's theme, and its positioning against the wall leaves ample space for additional elements.

The jewelry armoire, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location maintains balance and proportion within the room, ensuring no spatial conflicts with the chaise lounge. The armoire's elegant style and silver color contrast nicely with the chaise lounge, adding visual interest and functionality without overcrowding the space.

The tri-fold mirror, with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.8 meters, is centrally located on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures optimal visibility and accessibility, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The mirror's gold color adds a touch of luxury, aligning with the room's lavish theme.

A plush red rug, measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed under the chaise lounge in the middle of the room. This placement enhances comfort and style, providing a cohesive look to the dressing area. The rug's dimensions allow it to fit comfortably beneath the chaise lounge without overlapping other objects, maintaining the room's flow.

Ambient lighting is provided by a gold-colored light fixture, which is centrally placed on the ceiling. This placement ensures even illumination throughout the room, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The light fixture's dimensions are 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters, fitting well within the ceiling space without conflicting with any existing objects.

Finally, a decorative vase, made of ceramic and measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed on top of the jewelry armoire. This placement adds a decorative accent without obstructing the room's functionality, enhancing the luxurious theme with its white color and elegant style.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to avoid spatial conflicts, maintain the room's luxurious theme, and ensure functionality. The arrangement of objects adheres to design principles, ensuring balance, proportion, and aesthetic appeal throughout the room.
