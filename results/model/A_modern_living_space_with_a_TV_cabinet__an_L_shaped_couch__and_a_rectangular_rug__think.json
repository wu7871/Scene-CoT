## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern living space characterized by a TV cabinet, an L-shaped couch, and a rectangular rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while ensuring the total number of objects does not exceed 14. The user emphasizes a modern aesthetic, prioritizing functionality and style in the arrangement of furniture and decor.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The TV Viewing Area is designated for the TV cabinet, serving as the focal point. Adjacent to this is the Seating Area, featuring the L-shaped couch for comfort and entertainment. The Decorative Area includes the placement of a rug to add warmth and texture. Additionally, the Lighting Area is considered to enhance ambiance, although no specific lighting fixtures are recommended due to spatial constraints.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the TV Viewing Area, a modern TV cabinet with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter is recommended. The Seating Area features an L-shaped couch measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters, providing ample seating. A rectangular rug with dimensions of 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters is suggested for the Decorative Area. Although not explicitly requested, a coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters) is recommended to enhance the functionality and aesthetic of the seating area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The TV cabinet is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it serves as the focal point of the room, allowing viewers to have a direct line of sight while seated on the couch. The cabinet's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) fit well against the wall, maximizing space and maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The L-shaped couch is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement complements the TV cabinet's location, creating a balanced setup where viewers can easily view the TV. The couch's dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, enhancing the room's modern aesthetic and functionality.

The rug is centrally placed under the L-shaped couch, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) ensure it fits under the couch without extending beyond it, adding warmth and texture to the seating area. This placement maintains balance and proportion, aligning with the user's modern aesthetic preference.

The coffee table is placed directly in front of the L-shaped couch, facing the north wall. Positioned in the middle of the room, it does not conflict with the rug's placement and complements the existing setup. The coffee table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.5m) allow it to serve its function effectively while enhancing the room's aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of multiple decorative items on the TV cabinet, which could not accommodate them all due to spatial constraints. The conflict involved wall art, a decorative vase, and a potted plant. To resolve this, the wall art was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the vase and plant, which contribute more significantly to the room's modern aesthetic and functionality.
