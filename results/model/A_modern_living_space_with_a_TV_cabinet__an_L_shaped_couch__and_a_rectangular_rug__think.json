## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern living space characterized by a TV cabinet, an L-shaped couch, and a rectangular rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes a modern aesthetic, with a focus on creating a comfortable and stylish environment. The user desires a layout that supports relaxation and entertainment, incorporating elements such as ambient lighting, decorative cushions, and wall art to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The TV Viewing Area is designated for the TV cabinet and entertainment system, ensuring optimal viewing angles. The Seating Area includes the L-shaped couch, providing ample space for relaxation. The Central Area features the rectangular rug, enhancing the room's aesthetic and comfort. Additional elements like ambient lighting, decorative cushions, and wall art are strategically placed to complement the modern style and improve the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the TV Viewing Area, a modern-style TV cabinet with dimensions of 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended to house the television and entertainment system. The Seating Area features an L-shaped couch, measuring 3.5 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.9 meters, providing ergonomic support and comfort. A rectangular rug, sized at 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters, is suggested for the Central Area to define the space and add texture. Modern decorative cushions and wall art are recommended to enhance the room's aesthetic without cluttering the space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The TV cabinet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a focal point in the room. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring it does not obstruct the view to other parts of the room. This placement aligns with typical design practices for TV setups, enhancing the room's aesthetic while fulfilling functional requirements.

The L-shaped couch is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it does not obstruct the TV cabinet and provides a clear line of sight for viewers seated on the couch. The couch's dimensions (3.5m x 1.2m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The rug is centrally placed under the L-shaped couch, defining the seating area and adding warmth and texture to the room. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m) ensure it fits well under the couch without overlapping other furniture, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

Ambient lighting is installed on the ceiling to provide even illumination throughout the room. The light fixture's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) ensure it does not interfere with floor space or existing furniture, enhancing visibility and ambiance without cluttering the space.

Decorative cushions are placed on the L-shaped couch, adding color and comfort. Each cushion measures 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, fitting comfortably on the couch without causing spatial conflicts. Wall art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring it is visible from the seating area and enhances the room's aesthetic without obstructing any functional elements.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the TV cabinet and the south wall. The TV cabinet could not accommodate both the entertainment system and the smart TV, leading to the decision to delete the entertainment system based on its lower priority compared to the TV. Additionally, the south wall could not accommodate all intended objects, resulting in the deletion of the plant, floor lamp, and side table to maintain the room's functionality and user preference for a modern living space with a TV cabinet, L-shaped couch, and rectangular rug.
