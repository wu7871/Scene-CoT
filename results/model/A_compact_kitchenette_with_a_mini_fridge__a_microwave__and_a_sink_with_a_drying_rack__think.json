## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a compact kitchenette within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a functional space that includes a mini-fridge, microwave, sink with a drying rack, and adequate lighting. The user prefers a modern aesthetic with a cohesive color scheme and efficient use of space. Additional elements such as a countertop, bar stools, and a trash bin are considered to enhance functionality and comfort, but the total number of objects should not exceed ten to maintain a balance between functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Refrigeration Area is designated for the mini-fridge, serving as the focal point for food storage. Adjacent to this is the Cooking and Heating Area, which includes the microwave for quick heating tasks. The Preparation and Cleaning Area features the sink with a drying rack, facilitating washing and organizing dishes. Additionally, a Lighting Area is incorporated to ensure adequate illumination throughout the kitchenette.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Refrigeration Area, a modern-style mini-fridge with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.5 meters is recommended. The Cooking and Heating Area includes a microwave measuring 0.85 meters by 0.65 meters by 0.95 meters, positioned for easy access and use. The Preparation and Cleaning Area features a sink with a drying rack, although the latter was ultimately removed due to spatial constraints. A modern ceiling light with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters is recommended to provide ambient lighting. Bar stools and a countertop were initially considered to enhance functionality but were deleted to maintain the compact kitchenette concept.

## 4. Scene Graph
The mini-fridge is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures stability and accessibility, making it a focal point upon entering the room. The fridge's dimensions (0.8m x 0.6m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. The placement adheres to design principles by keeping the central area open for future additions.

The microwave is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This positioning ensures it is accessible from the mini-fridge and does not obstruct any pathways. The microwave's dimensions (0.85m x 0.65m x 0.95m) allow it to fit well against the wall, maintaining symmetry with the mini-fridge on the opposite side. This arrangement enhances the kitchenette's functionality while preserving aesthetic balance.

The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even distribution of light across the room. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) and modern style complement the kitchenette theme, providing necessary illumination without cluttering the floor space. This placement ensures optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to spatial constraints. The drying rack could not be placed right of the sink due to the microwave's position, and the microwave could not be left of the mini-fridge due to the sink's location. To resolve these conflicts, the drying rack and bar stools were deleted, prioritizing the core elements of the kitchenette—mini-fridge, microwave, and sink—to maintain functionality and user preference.
