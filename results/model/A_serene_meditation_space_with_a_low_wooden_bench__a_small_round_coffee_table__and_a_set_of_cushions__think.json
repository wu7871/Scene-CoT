## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene meditation space characterized by simplicity and tranquility. Essential components include a low wooden bench, a small round coffee table, and a set of cushions. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for meditation activities. The user prefers a natural aesthetic, emphasizing a cohesive and calming environment that supports relaxation and meditation.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Meditation Area is centered around the low wooden bench and cushions, facilitating meditation practices. The Coffee Table Area is positioned adjacent to the bench for convenience. The Lighting Area focuses on creating a calming atmosphere with ambient lighting. Additionally, a Decorative Area is included to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal without cluttering the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Meditation Area, a minimalist wooden bench (1.5m x 0.6m x 0.45m) and three minimalist cotton cushions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.2m each) are recommended to support meditation activities. The Coffee Table Area features a rustic wooden coffee table (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.45m) to hold items conveniently. A contemporary metal floor lamp (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) is suggested for the Lighting Area to provide ambient lighting. Finally, a bohemian-style wool rug (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.02m) is recommended to define the meditation area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden bench is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and allows for optimal lighting, making it a focal point for meditation activities. The bench's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 0.45m) fit well within the room, providing ample space for additional objects. The first cushion is placed directly in front of the bench, facing the north wall, ensuring it is adjacent and easily accessible for meditation. The second cushion is placed behind the bench, maintaining symmetry and balance in the arrangement. The third cushion is placed to the right of the bench, creating a balanced and inviting meditation setup.

The coffee table is centrally located under the bench, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access from all cushions, enhancing the functionality of the meditation setup. The table's rustic style complements the natural aesthetic desired by the user. The floor lamp is placed to the left of the bench, facing the east wall. This positioning provides ambient lighting to the entire meditation area without obstructing views or access to other objects. The rug is placed under the coffee table and partially under the bench, defining the meditation area and adding warmth and texture to the space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the incense holder, which could not be positioned left of the coffee table due to the presence of the rug. To resolve this, the incense holder was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the other elements of the meditation setup. This decision maintained the user's preference for a serene and functional meditation space without compromising the room's aesthetic and functional requirements.
