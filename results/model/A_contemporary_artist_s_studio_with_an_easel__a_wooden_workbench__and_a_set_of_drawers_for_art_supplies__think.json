## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary artist's studio that incorporates specific elements such as an easel, a wooden workbench, and a set of drawers for art supplies. The studio should facilitate painting activities, provide ample lighting, and maintain a harmonious and inspiring atmosphere. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, offering flexibility in layout and design. The user emphasizes a contemporary aesthetic, focusing on essential items that enhance both functionality and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into several key substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Easel Area is positioned against the south wall, serving as the focal point for painting activities. Adjacent to this is the Workbench Area, which provides a stable surface for crafting and mixing colors. The Storage Area, located on the east wall, is designated for organizing art supplies efficiently. Additionally, the Lighting Area focuses on ensuring adequate illumination throughout the studio, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Easel Area, a contemporary wooden easel with dimensions of 1.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 2.0 meters is recommended to support painting activities. The Workbench Area features a robust wooden workbench measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 1.0 meter, providing a stable surface for crafting. A set of contemporary metal drawers, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.5 meters, is suggested for the Storage Area to organize art supplies efficiently. To enhance lighting, a modern metal light fixture, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters, is recommended to be centrally placed on the ceiling. Additional decorative elements include wall art and plants to enhance the studio's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a central element for painting, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures stability and optimal lighting conditions, allowing the artist to have a full view of the studio while working. The easel's dimensions (1.0m x 0.8m x 2.0m) fit well against the wall, making it a focal point without obstructing movement. The workbench, essential for crafting and mixing colors, is placed adjacent to the easel on the south wall, facing the north wall. This arrangement creates a cohesive painting area, with the workbench's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) fitting comfortably alongside the easel.

The drawers, intended for storing art supplies, are placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures they do not interfere with the functionality of the easel and workbench, while remaining easily accessible. The drawers' dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.5m) allow them to fit snugly against the wall, enhancing the studio's contemporary look. The light fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing even illumination across the studio. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) ensure it does not interfere with floor-standing objects, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Wall art is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, adding a decorative touch without obstructing other elements. The plant is placed on the floor near the east wall, facing the west wall, enhancing the aesthetic without hindering the studio's functionality. The stool, initially placed behind the workbench, was removed due to spatial conflicts, prioritizing the essential elements of the studio.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose with the stool and the light fixture. The stool could not be placed behind the workbench due to the presence of the easel, leading to its removal as it was deemed less critical compared to the easel, workbench, and drawers. The light fixture was also removed due to spatial constraints with the workbench, prioritizing the essential elements of the studio and maintaining the user's preference for a contemporary artist's studio with an easel, wooden workbench, and set of drawers.
