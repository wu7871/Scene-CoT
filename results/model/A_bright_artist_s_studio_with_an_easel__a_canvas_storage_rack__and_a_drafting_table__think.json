## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a vibrant and creative artist's studio that emphasizes painting, storing canvases, and sketching. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for artistic activities. Key elements include an easel for painting, a canvas storage rack for organizing materials, and a drafting table for sketching. The user desires a bright and inspiring atmosphere, suggesting the inclusion of a skylight or window to maximize natural light. Additional recommendations include seating for comfort, a lighting fixture for focused illumination, and decorative elements to reflect the artist's personality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Central Painting Area is designated for the easel, providing stability and optimal lighting conditions. The Canvas Storage Area is intended for organizing and storing canvases efficiently. The Sketching and Drawing Area includes the drafting table, complemented by a comfortable chair for prolonged use. An Open Central Space is maintained for flexibility, allowing easy movement and interaction with various art tools. Additionally, a Lighting Area is identified for enhancing visibility, particularly around the drafting table.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Painting Area, a classic-style wooden easel with dimensions of 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended. The Canvas Storage Area features a modern metal rack measuring 2.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.0 meters. In the Sketching and Drawing Area, a contemporary drafting table (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.95 meters) is suggested, along with a matching chair (0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters) for comfort. A modern lighting fixture (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) is recommended for the Lighting Area to ensure adequate illumination. Decorative elements such as wall art and a potted plant are proposed to enhance the studio's aesthetic and maintain a bright and inspiring environment.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a fundamental component for painting, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures it does not obstruct the central workspace and provides a stable backdrop for painting activities. The easel's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. The placement supports the user's preference for a bright artist's studio, ensuring the easel remains accessible and functional without cluttering the space.

The canvas storage rack is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures accessibility for storing canvases while keeping the central area open for painting activities. The rack's dimensions (2.0m x 0.5m x 2.0m) allow it to fit well against the wall, complementing the studio's function and aesthetic. It is placed at a height that allows easy access without obstructing the view or use of the easel, maintaining a balanced layout.

The drafting table is centrally located in the room, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it is not obstructed by other objects and is easily accessible for sketching and drawing. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.95m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle of the room, ensuring it remains the focal point for sketching activities. The placement complements the studio's design, providing balance and accessibility.

The chair is placed in front of the drafting table, facing the south wall. This placement ensures ergonomic use of the table and maintains a functional layout. The chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably in front of the table without causing spatial conflicts. It complements the studio's design and enhances the functionality of the space.

The lighting fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downward. This placement ensures even illumination across the room, particularly benefiting the drafting table area. The fixture's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with floor-standing objects. It enhances the studio's ambiance and functionality, aligning with the user's vision for a bright studio.

Wall art is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it is visible from the center of the room, enhancing the studio's aesthetic without obstructing functionality. The art's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably on the wall, adding vibrancy and creativity to the studio environment.

The potted plant is placed on the floor, adjacent to the canvas storage rack on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement adds greenery and aesthetic value without obstructing the studio's primary functions. The plant's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the rack, enhancing the studio's ambiance and maintaining balance and proportion.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional artist's studio. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 6. Object Placement
For easel_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with no child
        - calculation:
            - easel_1 has no child, so no rotation difference calculation needed.
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation required.
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'north_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - easel_1 size: length=0.7, width=0.7, height=1.8
            - Cluster size: {'left of': 0.0, 'right of': 0.0, 'behind': 0.0, 'in front': 0.0}
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied.
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'north_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.7/2 = 0.35
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.7/2 = 4.65
            - y_min = 5.0 - 0.7/2 = 4.65
            - y_max = 5.0 - 0.7/2 = 4.65
            - z_min = z_max = 1.8/2 = 0.9
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.35, 4.65, 4.65, 4.65, 0.9, 0.9)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.35-4.65), y(4.65-4.65)
        - conclusion: Valid placement boundaries confirmed.
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects present for collision check.
        - conclusion: No collision detected.
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=1.5779, y=4.65, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.5779, y: 4.65, z: 0.9
