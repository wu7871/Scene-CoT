## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic library setting within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a set of wooden bookcases, a leather reading chair, and a vintage globe, all contributing to a classic and timeless aesthetic. The user emphasizes the importance of creating a spacious and inviting environment conducive to reading and relaxation, with adequate lighting provided by a chandelier. Additional objects such as a side table, area rug, and decorative vase are suggested to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Bookcase Area is designated along the north wall for storing books and displaying the vintage globe. The Reading Chair Area is centrally located, providing a comfortable spot for reading. The Lighting Area is defined by the placement of the chandelier, ensuring even illumination throughout the room. Additional substructures include the Side Table Area next to the reading chair for convenience, and the Rug Area under the reading chair to define the reading zone.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, classic-style wooden bookcases with dimensions of 4.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.5 meters are recommended to store books and display the globe. The Reading Chair Area features a classic leather reading chair (1.057 meters by 0.935 meters by 1.066 meters) and a matching armchair (1.049 meters by 0.957 meters by 1.076 meters) for added comfort. A vintage globe (0.714 meters by 0.579 meters by 0.864 meters) is suggested for display. The Lighting Area includes a crystal chandelier (1.063 meters by 1.063 meters by 1.374 meters) to provide ambient lighting. A dark brown wooden side table (0.766 meters by 0.766 meters by 0.857 meters) complements the reading setup, while a beige wool rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) defines the reading area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bookcase, a central element for storing books and displaying the globe, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures stability and maximizes floor space, allowing easy access and visibility from the reading chair. The bookcase's dimensions (4.0m x 0.5m x 2.5m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. The vintage globe, intended for display, is placed on top of the bookcase, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures it is visible and accessible without obstructing the bookcase's function, enhancing the classic library theme.

The reading chair, a key piece for comfort and functionality, is placed in the middle of the room, facing the south wall. This central placement allows for optimal access to the bookcase and globe, maintaining a balanced and inviting layout. The armchair, designed for additional seating, is positioned to the right of the reading chair, also facing the south wall. This arrangement creates a cohesive reading area, enhancing the room's classic aesthetic.

The chandelier, providing necessary lighting, is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even illumination across the room. Its placement above the reading area ensures it does not interfere with other objects, maintaining aesthetic harmony. The side table is placed to the left of the reading chair, adjacent to it, facing the south wall. This placement provides a convenient surface for holding items while seated, complementing the reading chair's classic style.

The rug, defining the reading area, is placed under the reading chair and partially under the armchair, in the middle of the room. It faces the south wall, aligning with the orientation of the reading chair and armchair. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic and functional appeal, creating a cozy reading nook.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited length of the north wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. Specifically, the side table, bookcase, armchair, reading chair, and rug were initially planned but faced spatial constraints. To resolve these conflicts, the rug, side table, armchair, reading chair, and bookcase were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a classic library with wooden bookcases and a leather reading chair. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's vision.
