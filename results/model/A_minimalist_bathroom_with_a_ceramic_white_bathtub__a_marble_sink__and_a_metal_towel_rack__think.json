## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist bathroom characterized by a ceramic white bathtub, a marble sink, and a metal towel rack. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes simplicity and functionality, with a focus on creating an open and serene environment. The user prefers a minimalist aesthetic, which means the room should remain uncluttered and visually harmonious, with a cohesive color palette and proportionate object sizes.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into three main areas: the Bathtub Area, the Sink Area, and the Towel Rack Area. The Bathtub Area is designated for bathing and relaxation, featuring the ceramic white bathtub as the central element. The Sink Area includes the marble sink and a mirror, providing functionality for washing and grooming. The Towel Rack Area is intended for drying purposes, ensuring convenience and accessibility. Each area is designed to maintain a minimalist aesthetic while fulfilling specific functional needs.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bathtub Area, a minimalist ceramic white bathtub is recommended, serving as the focal point of the room. The Sink Area features a marble sink and a minimalist glass mirror, enhancing the bathroom's functionality and aesthetic. In the Towel Rack Area, a metal towel rack is suggested to provide easy access to towels. Additional recommendations include a minimalist bath mat for floor protection and comfort, a small shelf for storing bathroom essentials, and a ceiling light fixture to ensure adequate illumination. A wall-mounted soap dispenser is also recommended to maintain the minimalist theme and enhance functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The ceramic white bathtub is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and maximizes space usage, aligning with the minimalist aesthetic. The bathtub's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.8 meters in height. Its central alignment along the south wall provides balance and symmetry, allowing for potential future additions like a shower area or a small seating arrangement.

Above the bathtub, a minimalist glass mirror is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures functionality by being directly above the bathtub, enhancing both aesthetic and practical value. The mirror's dimensions are 1.5 meters in length, 0.1 meter in width, and 1.0 meter in height, fitting well above the bathtub without causing spatial conflicts.

The metal towel rack is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures it is easily accessible after using the bathtub or sink, maintaining a clean and organized look. The towel rack's dimensions are 0.6 meters in length, 0.2 meters in width, and 1.8 meters in height, fitting comfortably against the wall without interfering with other objects.

A minimalist ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downwards. This placement ensures even lighting distribution throughout the bathroom, complementing the minimalist design. The light's dimensions are 0.45 meters in length, 0.45 meters in width, and 0.9 meters in height, fitting well within the ceiling's space without obstructing any existing objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the bath mat, as the width of the bathtub was too small to accommodate the bath mat in front of it. To resolve this, the bath mat was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a minimalist bathroom with essential elements like the bathtub, sink, and towel rack. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic, ensuring a clean and uncluttered space.
