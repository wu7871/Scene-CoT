## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious bathroom characterized by a freestanding tub, a double vanity, and a walk-in shower. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes elegance and functionality, with a focus on creating distinct areas for bathing, grooming, and storage. The user prefers a luxurious aesthetic, incorporating elements such as marble flooring, gold fixtures, and ambient lighting to enhance the room's opulence.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the freestanding tub, serving as the focal point of the room. The south wall is allocated for the double vanity, providing storage and grooming facilities. The east wall is reserved for the walk-in shower, ensuring it remains separate from the bathtub area. The floor covering the entire room is made of marble to align with the luxurious theme. Additional elements like gold fixtures and ambient lighting are strategically placed to enhance the room's aesthetic and functional appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a luxurious freestanding tub made of ceramic, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 1.2 meters, is recommended. The south wall will house a double vanity with dimensions of 2.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.5 meters, offering ample storage and grooming space. The east wall features a modern glass walk-in shower, measuring 1.8 meters by 1.8 meters by 2.5 meters, providing a spacious shower area. The floor is covered with luxurious marble, enhancing the room's aesthetic. Gold fixtures, including a faucet and towel rack, are recommended to complement the luxurious theme. Ambient lighting is suggested to provide warm illumination and enhance the room's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The freestanding tub is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it becomes the focal point of the bathroom, allowing easy access from all sides and maximizing its luxurious appeal. The tub's dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 1.2m) fit well within the room's size, and its central location maintains balance and proportion, adhering to design principles.

The double vanity is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement provides stability and ensures it does not obstruct the central area where the freestanding tub is located. The vanity's dimensions (2.5m x 1.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, enhancing the luxurious aesthetic while providing necessary storage and grooming facilities.

The walk-in shower is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This positioning ensures it is distinct from the freestanding tub and double vanity, maintaining a clear layout within the room. The shower's dimensions (1.8m x 1.8m x 2.5m) fit well along the west wall, providing optimal functionality and aesthetic alignment with the luxurious theme.

Marble covers the entire floor, providing a luxurious and cohesive look throughout the bathroom. The marble's dimensions (5.0m x 5.0m x 0.02m) ensure it covers the floor without overlapping other objects, enhancing both the aesthetic and functional appeal of the room.

A gold fixture, initially intended for the freestanding tub, is repositioned to the sink of the double vanity due to spatial constraints. This placement ensures the fixture complements the luxurious theme while providing functional benefits such as water supply and lighting.

Ambient lighting is installed on the ceiling, providing even illumination across the room. The light fixture's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.4m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, enhancing the luxurious ambiance and providing necessary lighting.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose with the towel rack and gold fixture. The towel rack could not be placed left of the double vanity due to the freestanding tub's position. Additionally, the gold fixture could not be placed on the freestanding tub due to spatial constraints. To resolve these conflicts, the towel rack was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a luxurious bathroom with essential elements like the freestanding tub, double vanity, and walk-in shower. The gold fixture was repositioned to the sink of the double vanity, ensuring it complements the luxurious theme and provides functional benefits.
